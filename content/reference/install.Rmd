You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). You will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.



## Install R

First you need to install R itself (the engine).

1. Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)^[It's a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.] website: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
2. Click on "Download R for `XXX`", where `XXX` is either Mac or Windows:

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
    include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-links.png", error = FALSE)
    ```

    - If you use macOS, scroll down to the first `.pkg` file in the list of files (in this picture, it's `R-4.0.0.pkg`; as of right now, the current version is also 4.0.0) and download it.
    
        ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
        include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-mac.png", error = FALSE)
        ```
    
    - If you use Windows, click "base" (or click on the bolded "install R for the first time" link) and download it. 
    
        ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
        include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-windows.png", error = FALSE)
        ```

3. Double click on the downloaded file (check your `Downloads` folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.

4. If you use macOS, [download and install XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/). You do not need to do this on Windows.


## Install RStudio

Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won't ever have to interact with it directly.

1. Go to the free download location on RStudio's website: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>
2. The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
    include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-rstudio1.png", error = FALSE)
    ```
    
    If not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.

    ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
    include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-rstudio2.png", error = FALSE)
    ```

3. Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your `Downloads` folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.

Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).


## Install (CRAN) packages

Most R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on "Install," type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-package-panel.png", error = FALSE)
```


A less tedious way to do this is via the console or in your script (just make sure to delete afterwards!), by running the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("name_of_package")
```


## Install (non-CRAN) packages

Not all R packages are on CRAN.
