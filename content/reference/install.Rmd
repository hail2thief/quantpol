You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). You will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboardâ€”R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.



## Install R

First you need to install R itself (the engine).

1. If you have a **WINDOWS**, click here: [Download R 4.1.1 for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.1.1-win.exe)
2. If you have a **MAC**, click here: [Download R 4.1.1 for macOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/base/R-4.1.1.pkg)
3. Double click on the downloaded file (check your `Downloads` folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.

4. If you use macOS, [download and install XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/). You do not need to do this on Windows.


## Install RStudio

Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won't ever have to interact with R directly.

1. If you have a **WINDOWS**, click here: [Download RStudio for Windows](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-1.4.1717.exe)
2. If you have a **MAC**, click here: [Download RStudio for macOS](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/macos/RStudio-1.4.1717.dmg)
3. Double click on the downloaded file (check your `Downloads` folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.

Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).

Here's a [helpful walkthrough from Kieran Healy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UITYisElZ8)


## Install (CRAN) packages

Most R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on "Install," type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
include_graphics("/img/install/install-r-package-panel.png", error = FALSE)
```


A less tedious way to do this is via the console or in your script (just make sure to delete afterwards!), by running the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("name_of_package")
```
