<p>Most of the data in this course will come from packages. I do this so we have more time to focus on the stuff that matters. But most of the data in the world is not in a package. How can I read this kind of data into R?</p>
<p>There’s ways to do this in Rstudio through <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/218611977-Importing-Data-with-the-RStudio-IDE">drop-down menus</a> but I call that the “no learning” approach.</p>
<p>To read data into R you need to know two things:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What kind of file is it? What is its <em>extension</em>?</li>
<li>Where is it? What is its <em>file path</em>?</li>
</ol>
<div id="what-kind-of-file-is-it" class="section level2">
<h2>What kind of file is it?</h2>
<p>There are many different types of files out there. You can tell what type of file a dataset is by looking at its <strong>extension</strong> - the bit in the file name that comes after the period. Some common file types/extensions are <code>.csv</code>, <code>.dta</code>, <code>.xlsx</code>, etc.</p>
<p>R has different functions you can use to import different types of files. For a <code>.csv</code> file you would use <code>read_csv()</code> or <code>read.csv()</code>. For a <code>.dta</code> you would use <code>read_dta()</code> from the <code>{haven}</code> package. For an <code>.xlsx</code> file you would use <code>read_excel()</code> from <code>{readxl}</code>. If you’re not sure, google what function to use for a particular data file.</p>
</div>
<div id="where-is-it" class="section level2">
<h2>Where is it?</h2>
<p>This part is tricky for people who don’t have a lot of experience working with computers. But, in short: every file that is on your computer has a “path” or “address” that uniquely identifies it on your computer. This address changes with your file’s location; if you moved the file for whatever reason, the file path would change. You need the file path in order to tell R where to look at your data.</p>
<p>How to find it? Operating systems are always changing so in general the best thign is to google how to find a file’s filepath and then remember it. But the following seems to have worked on Mac for a long time now:</p>
<ul>
<li>find the file in your Finder</li>
<li>right-click and select “get info”</li>
<li>at the top left, under “General”, you’ll see the file path next to “Where:”</li>
<li>right-click that path and select “copy as Pathname”</li>
</ul>
<p>And on Windows you can <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/670447/how-to-copy-the-full-path-of-a-file-on-windows-10/">do this</a>.</p>
<p>Code to import data into R might look like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df = read_csv(&quot;/Users/juan/Dropbox/teaching/co2-data/owid-co2-data.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>How to do this better</h2>
<p>For working on longer term projects, it is more convenient to use <em>relative</em> file paths in conjunction with something like R projects (<code>.Rproj</code>) + the <code>{here}</code> library.</p>
