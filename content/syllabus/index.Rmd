## Course objectives

Data is everywhere. Policymakers, academics, journalists, financial analysts, and many others use data every day to make decisions. Data is also being used to make **causal** claims about the world -- to argue that taking some course of action will improve or worsen our lives. In this class, you will learn how to **do** data analysis and how to **think** causally. 


You will spend a lot of time getting off the ground in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), a powerful and in-demand programming language that will allow you to manipulate, summarize, and visualize the data that you care about. You will also develop a language and set of tools for determining whether, and how, we can know that one thing *causes* another using data. 


This course is meant for students without any statistics or programming background. We will emphasize hands-on application with software and intuition-building over statistical theory and mathematical proofs.


By the end of this course, you will be able to:


1. Feel comfortable manipulating data in R
2. Craft effective visualizations of patterns in data
3. Draw causal diagrams and identify challenges to causal claims
4. Understand the basics of causal inference


## Course materials

All materials for this course are *free and online*.

### Books, articles, and other readings

We will mostly use these two online textbooks:

- [**ModernDive**](https://moderndive.com/) 

- [**R for Data Science**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)


Outside of the textbooks, I will post links to additional articles and videos on this site. I also recommend subscribing to the [R Weekly newsletter](https://rweekly.org/). This weekly email is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R.




### R and RStudio


You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). You will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the main program to access R. 



## Course Policies

### Communicating with me


Slack will be our main mode of communication. We have a class Slack channel where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. Ask questions about coding (e.g., "how do I summarize multiple variables at once?") or class logistics (e.g., "I can't find the reading") in the class Slack workspace. 


I will monitor Slack regularly, and you should all do so as well. You'll have similar questions as your peers, and you'll likely be able to answer other peoples' questions too. I will also post announcements and interesting/helpful content on Slack as the semester progresses.


If you would like to speak with me about something that only pertains to *you* (e.g., your grades, academic advice, reading suggestions), you can sign up for office hours on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/juan-f-tellez). If there's a time-sensitive issue you can email me. Everything else goes in the Slack so that others can see and access help. 


### Honor Code

Be nice. Don't cheat. The Carolinian Creed is in effect in this class and all others at the University. I will treat violations seriously and urge all students to become familiar with its terms set out [here](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_conduct_and_academic_integrity/index.php). If you have doubts, it is your responsibility to ask about the Creed’s application.


<!-- ### Cell Phones and Laptops -->


<!-- - Please turn off your phones or put them on silent before class.  -->
<!-- - Be respectful with your laptop use. This course will involve heavy laptop use in class, so it is up to you to avoid distractions.  -->


### Counseling & Psychiatry Services


Life at USC can be complicated and challenging. You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. [Counseling and Psychiatry Services](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_health_services/medical-services/counseling-and-psychiatry/index.php) provides *confidential* support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. Please do not hesitate to contact CPS for assistance—getting help is a smart and good thing to do.



## Assignments and grades

You can find descriptions for all the assignments on the [assignments page](/assignment/).


```{r assignments-grades, include=FALSE}
assignments <- tribble(
  ~Points, ~Assignment,
  200  , "Problem sets (10 × 20)",
  150     , "Midterm",
  150     , "Final"
) %>%
  mutate(Percent = Points / sum(Points),
         Percent = scales::percent(Percent))

grading <- tribble(
  ~Grade, ~Range, ~Grade1, ~Range1,
  "A",  "93–100%", "C",  "73–76%",
  "A−", "90–92%", "C−", "70–72%",
  "B+", "87–89%", "D+", "67–69%",
  "B",  "83–86%", "D",  "63–66%",
  "B−", "80–82%", "D−", "60–62%",
  "C+", "77–79%", "F",  "< 60%"
)
```

```{r show-assignments-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
assignments_total <- tibble(Assignment = "Total",
                                Points = sum(assignments$Points),
                                Percent = NA)

bind_rows(assignments, assignments_total) %>% 
  select(Assignment, Points, Percent) %>% 
  pandoc.table(justify = "lcc", missing = "—")
```


```{r show-grades-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
grading %>%
  pandoc.table(justify = "lclc", 
               col.names = c("Grade", "Range", "Grade", "Range"))
```


## Old tech

Once you have read this entire syllabus and [the assignments page](/assignment/), please post a picture or gif of an old computer, something with a [cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk) aesthetic, or some old technology to the Slack (2 extra credit points; you’ve got until January 18th).
