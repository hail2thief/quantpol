<div id="what-is-this-class-about" class="section level2">
<h2>What is this class about?</h2>
<p>Policymakers, academics, journalists, firms, NGOs and many others use quantitative data every day to make decisions. Data are also being used to make <strong>causal</strong> claims about the world – to argue that some policy will improve or worsen our lives.</p>
<p>This undergraduate course is about how to <strong>do</strong> data analysis and how to <strong>think</strong> causally about the political world. We will cover topics in data science, programming, regression, causal inference, and uncertainty.</p>
<p><em>This course assumes students have no statistics or programming background</em>. We will emphasize hands-on application with software and intuition-building instead of statistical theory and mathematical proofs.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-will-we-do-in-this-class" class="section level2">
<h2>What will we do in this class?</h2>
<p>Our class philosophy is all about <strong>doing</strong>. Readings are <strong>optional</strong> – everything you need to succeed in class is covered in lecture and section. There are also <strong>no exams</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead, you will spend time getting your hands dirty with data in weekly <strong>problem sets</strong> touching on the class content. You will also complete an <strong>original data analysis project</strong> on a topic of your choosing that you will showcase at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>You will do this all in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, a powerful and in-demand programming language that will allow you to manipulate, summarize, and visualize the data that you care about. You will also develop a conceptual language for determining whether, and how, we can know that one thing <strong>causes</strong> another using data.</p>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Feel comfortable manipulating data in R</li>
<li>Craft effective visualizations of patterns in data</li>
<li>Draw causal diagrams and identify obstacles to causal claims</li>
<li>Understand the basics of regression and uncertainty</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="what-will-we-do-in-discussion-section" class="section level2">
<h2>What will we do in discussion section?</h2>
<p>The weekly discussion sections will be the place to get help on lecture content, problem sets, and the final project. In section, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go over student questions from the week’s lecture content</li>
<li>Get help from the TAs on new problem sets and review answers from past problem sets</li>
<li>Get help from the TAs on your final project</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-materials-do-i-need-for-this-course" class="section level2">
<h2>What materials do I need for this course?</h2>
<p>All materials for this course are <strong>free and online</strong>. You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free) programming language <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>. You will use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> as the main program to access R.</p>
<p>Given the focus on programming, <em>you will need consistent access to a laptop or computer for this class</em>.</p>

<div id="how-can-i-get-help-or-get-in-contact-with-the-instructors" class="section level3">
<h3>How can I get help or get in contact with the instructors?</h3>
<p><em>Slack will be our main mode of communication</em>. We have a class Slack channel where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. Ask questions about coding (e.g., “how do I summarize multiple variables at once?”) or class logistics (e.g., “I can’t find the reading”) in the class Slack workspace.</p>
<p>The TA’s and I will monitor Slack regularly, and you should all do so as well. You’ll have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.</p>
<p><em>If you need one-on-one help you can also reach out to the TAs</em> to schedule a time to meet. The TAs and their office hours are at the top of this page.</p>
<p><em>If you would like to speak with me about something that only pertains to you</em> (e.g., your grades, academic advice), you can sign up for office hours on <a href="https://calendly.com/juan-f-tellez">Calendly</a>. If there’s a time-sensitive issue you can email me. Everything else goes in the Slack so that others can see and access help.</p>
</div>
<div id="honor-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Honor Code</h3>
<p>Be nice. Don’t cheat. The <a href="https://ossja.ucdavis.edu/code-academic-conduct">Code of Academic Conduct</a> is in effect in this class and all others at the University. I will treat violations seriously. If you have doubts, it is your responsibility to ask about the Code’s application.</p>
