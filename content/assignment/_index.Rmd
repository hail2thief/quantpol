## Preparation

You will succeed in this class if you (1) attend lecture, (2) attend section, and (3) do the problem sets.


## Lecture participation


During lecture I will ask for student input using iClicker. As a function of proportion of time you do iClicker. 


## Problem sets

To practice coding in R you will complete problem sets throughout the quarter. Feel free to work together on the problem sets but **you must turn in your own answers to Canvas.** You cannot work in groups of more than **three** people.


I'll accept problem sets late one day (but you will lose a full letter-grade). Beyond that I won't accept late problem sets. 


## Section participation


To keep track of how students are doing in class and what they are getting stuck on, you will complete a **weekly check-in** on Canvas that simply asks you what (if anything) you found confusing from the week's content. TAs will then compile and discuss the top issues in section. 

Section participation points combine this weekly check-in with your participation in section. 


## Final project


The final project for this class will be an **original** analysis of data that you care about. The project **must** incorporate: 

1. A significant amount of data wrangling
2. At least one visualization of the main idea in the project
3. A DAG outlining barriers to causal identification
4. Other statistics, figures, or details that flesh out the project


The primary deliverable will be:

1. a **Powerpoint slide** summarizing and visualizing the main idea in your project
2. a short memo providing added detail to explain the project
3. an R script to reproduce your analysis
