## Preparation

You will succeed in this class if you (1) attend lecture, (2) attend section, and (3) do the problem sets.


## Weekly check-in


Every week, while you finish working through the content, I want to hear about what you learned and what questions you still have. To do this, you will fill out a short-response on Canvas that simply asks you what (if anything) you: 1) found interesting or compelling from the content so far; 2) found confusing or muddly from the content so far. TAs will compile and discuss the top issues in section. 

I'll accept check-ins late one day (but you will lose a full letter-grade). Beyond that it's a zero. 


## Problem sets

To practice coding in R you will complete problem sets throughout the quarter. Feel free to work together on the problem sets but **you must turn in your own answers to Canvas.** You cannot work in groups of more than **three** people.


I'll accept problem sets late one day (but you will lose a full letter-grade). Beyond that I won't accept late problem sets. 



## Final project


See here: [final project details](/assignment/final-project/)

<!-- The final project for this class will be an **original** analysis of data that you care about. The project **must** incorporate:  -->

<!-- 1. A significant amount of data wrangling -->
<!-- 2. At least one visualization of the main idea in the project -->
<!-- 3. A DAG outlining barriers to causal identification -->
<!-- 4. Other statistics, figures, or details that flesh out the project -->
