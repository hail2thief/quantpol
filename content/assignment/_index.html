<div id="logistics" class="section level1">
<h1>Logistics</h1>
<div id="preparation" class="section level2">
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>You will succeed in this class if you (1) attend lecture, (2) attend section, and (3) do the problem sets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="assignments" class="section level1">
<h1>Assignments</h1>
<div id="weekly-check-in" class="section level2">
<h2>Weekly check-in</h2>
<p>Every week, while you finish working through the content, I want to hear about what you learned and what questions you still have. To do this, you will fill out a short-response on Canvas that simply asks you what (if anything) you: 1) found interesting or compelling from the content so far; 2) found confusing or muddly from the content so far.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-sets" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem sets</h2>
<p>To practice coding in R you will complete problem sets throughout the quarter. Feel free to work together on the problem sets but <strong>you must turn in your own answers to Canvas.</strong> You cannot work in groups of more than <strong>three</strong> people.</p>
</div>
<div id="coding-challenges-extra-credit" class="section level2">
<h2>Coding challenges (<strong>extra credit</strong>)</h2>
<p>From time to time, I will hold in-lecture ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ <strong>coding challenges</strong> ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ that the whole class will participate in. Students will have the opportunity to earn extra credit during these challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Final project</h2>
<p>You will code â€“ using all of the tools from the course â€“ an original data analysis of a mystery dataset. The format will be similar to the homeworks: a take-home RMD file with instructions and empty code chunks for you to fill in. Plus places to write your own analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="grade-disputes" class="section level2">
<h2>Grade disputes</h2>
<p>If you believe that you received the wrong grade on an assignment or exam:</p>
<ul>
<li>send an email specifying <strong>exactly</strong> which questions you believe were graded incorrectly, and provide <strong>specific</strong> justification for why your answer is the correct one. We will then regrade your entire assignment. Your grade may go up, down, or stay the same</li>
<li>I will <strong>only accept grade appeals up to three days after the posting of a grade</strong></li>
</ul>
<div id="extensions-on-assignments-excluding-final-project" class="section level3">
<h3>Extensions on assignments (excluding final project)</h3>
<p>You can turn in the problem set/weekly check-in one day late, no questions asked, though you will lose a full letter-grade. Beyond that I will not accept late assignments without a doctorâ€™s note, so donâ€™t ask! The final project will not be accepted late.</p>
