<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>You will succeed in this class if you (1) attend lecture, (2) attend section, and (3) do the problem sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="weekly-check-in" class="section level2">
<h2>Weekly check-in</h2>
<p>Every week, while you finish working through the content, I want to hear about what you learned and what questions you still have. To do this, you will fill out a short-response on Canvas that simply asks you what (if anything) you: 1) found interesting or compelling from the content so far; 2) found confusing or muddly from the content so far. TAs will compile and discuss the top issues in section.</p>
<p>I’ll accept check-ins late one day (but you will lose a full letter-grade). Beyond that it’s a zero.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-sets" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem sets</h2>
<p>To practice coding in R you will complete problem sets throughout the quarter. Feel free to work together on the problem sets but <strong>you must turn in your own answers to Canvas.</strong> You cannot work in groups of more than <strong>three</strong> people.</p>
<p>I’ll accept problem sets late one day (but you will lose a full letter-grade). Beyond that I won’t accept late problem sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Final project</h2>
<p>See here: <a href="/assignment/final-project/">final project details</a></p>
<!-- The final project for this class will be an **original** analysis of data that you care about. The project **must** incorporate:  -->
<!-- 1. A significant amount of data wrangling -->
<!-- 2. At least one visualization of the main idea in the project -->
<!-- 3. A DAG outlining barriers to causal identification -->
<!-- 4. Other statistics, figures, or details that flesh out the project -->
</div>
