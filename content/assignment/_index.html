<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>You will succeed in this class if you (1) attend lecture, (2) attend section, and (3) do the problem sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="lecture-participation" class="section level2">
<h2>Lecture participation</h2>
<p>During lecture I will ask for student input using iClicker. As a function of proportion of time you do iClicker.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-sets" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem sets</h2>
<p>To practice coding in R you will complete problem sets throughout the quarter. Feel free to work together on the problem sets but <strong>you must turn in your own answers to Canvas.</strong> You cannot work in groups of more than <strong>three</strong> people.</p>
<p>I’ll accept problem sets late one day (but you will lose a full letter-grade). Beyond that I won’t accept late problem sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-participation" class="section level2">
<h2>Section participation</h2>
<p>To keep track of how students are doing in class and what they are getting stuck on, you will complete a <strong>weekly check-in</strong> on Canvas that simply asks you what (if anything) you found confusing from the week’s content. TAs will then compile and discuss the top issues in section.</p>
<p>Section participation points combine this weekly check-in with your participation in section.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Final project</h2>
<p>The final project for this class will be an <strong>original</strong> analysis of data that you care about. The project <strong>must</strong> incorporate:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A significant amount of data wrangling</li>
<li>At least one visualization of the main idea in the project</li>
<li>A DAG outlining barriers to causal identification</li>
<li>Other statistics, figures, or details that flesh out the project</li>
</ol>
<p>The primary deliverable will be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a <strong>Powerpoint slide</strong> summarizing and visualizing the main idea in your project</li>
<li>a short memo providing added detail to explain the project</li>
<li>an R script to reproduce your analysis</li>
</ol>
</div>
