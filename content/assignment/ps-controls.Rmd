## Tips

- Make sure you: 
    - run all of the code chunks that already have code in them
    - write your code in the empty code chunks
- Useful shortcuts: 
    - to run all the code in a specific code chunk, press the green right-facing triangle at the top right of the code chunk
    - to run all *prior* code chunks, press the downward-facing gray triangle at the top right of the code chunk
