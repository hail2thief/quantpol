## Drawing lines (geom_smooth)


Why draw trend lines? Trend lines give us a good, educated guess as to what the value of a Y variable is given some value of X. We can draw a trend line (or line of best fit) using `geom_smooth`, as below. Notice `method = "lm"`. 


```{r, warning=F,message=F}
# libraries
library(tidyverse)

# mtcars
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
