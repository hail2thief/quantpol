We *can* use models to capture the effect of X on Y, if in fact X does affect Y

--


Problem is some correlations are causal, others aren't

How can we tell?

# Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs)

A popular modeling tool for thinking about causality is the **DAG**

Nodes (points) = variables; Edges (arrows) = direction of *causality*


```{r}
dagify(Y ~ X + Z + A + B, 
       X ~ Z + W, 
       Z ~ B, 
       A ~ B + W, 
       exposure = "X", outcome = "Y") %>% 
  ggdag_status(stylized = TRUE) + 
  theme_dag(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red))
```

# DAGs


Nodes = variables; Arrows = direction of *causality*

```{r,out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
dagify(Y ~ X1, 
       coords = c(list(x = c(X1 = 1, Y = 1.5), 
                       y = c(X1 = 1, Y = 1)))) %>% 
  ggdag(node_size = 20, text_size = 5, stylized = TRUE) + theme_dag()
```


Read: X1 has an effect on Y

# DAGs



```{r, out.width = "80%"}
dagify(Y ~ X1, 
       X1 ~ X2) %>% 
  ggdag(node_size = 18, text_size = 4.5, stylized = TRUE) + theme_dag()
```

--

X1 has an effect on Y; X2 has an effect on X1; X2 affects Y *only through* X1

*Missing* arrows matter!

X1 has an effect on Y; X2 has an effect on X1 and Y (via X1); X3 has an effect on X1 and Y

# Example: ideology

# DAGs

DAGs encode everything we know about some process

--


We can see all of our assumptions and how they fit together

--


For example: the effect of Parents on how Liberal someone is happens *directly* and *indirectly* (through Media)

--

Missing arrows also matter: we are assuming that Age has *no effect* on Media diet

# Identification


Why do this? As we will see, DAGs help us figure out how to estimate the effect of one variable on another

--

While at the same time being mindful of all the other variables that we need to **adjust**, or **control** for

--


For instance, we might want to estimate the effect of Media consumption (M) on how Liberal (L) someone is

This process is called "identification" $\rightarrow$ to **identify** the effect of X on Y

# Does Waffle House cause divorce?

--

Almost certainly *not*

--

No one thinks there is a *plausible* way in which Waffle House causes divorce

--

When we see a correlation of this kind we wonder about other variables that are **actually** driving the relationship

--

You've likely thought about this before: *a "lurking" variable, "other factors", that "matter"*

--

But what might that *variable* be? And *how* exactly does it lead us astray?


---


# The lurking variable


It turns out that Waffle Houses originated in the South (Georgia), and most of them are still there

--

The South also happens to have some of the highest divorce rates in the country

---


# The DAG


So the DAG might look something like this: South **has an effect on** Waffle Houses and Divorce, but Waffles **do not cause** Divorce


```{r, out.width="80%"}
dagify(Divorce ~ South, 
       Waffle ~ South, 
       exposure = "Waffle",
       outcome = "Divorce", 
       coords = list(x = c(Waffle = 0, Divorce = 2, South = 1), 
                      y = c(Waffle = 0, Divorce = 0, South = 1))) %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) + theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(blue, red))
```

---


# The problem


```{r, out.width="60%"}
dagify(Divorce ~ South, 
       Waffle ~ South, 
       exposure = "Waffle",
       outcome = "Divorce", 
       coords = list(x = c(Waffle = 0, Divorce = 2, South = 1), 
                      y = c(Waffle = 0, Divorce = 0, South = 1))) %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) + theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(blue, red))
```

--


A DAG like this will produce a *correlation* between Waffles and Divorce, even when there is no **causal** relationship

--


This is called **confounding**: the South is **confounding** the relationship between Waffles and Divorce


---


# How does this happen?


Let's make up data to convince ourselves this is true

--

fifty states, about half of them are in the South

--

```{r, echo  = TRUE}
tibble(south = sample(c(0, 1), size = 50, replace = TRUE))
```

---


# Simulate the treatment


Step 2: make Waffle houses, let's say about 20 per million residents, +/- 4

```{r, echo = TRUE}
tibble(south = sample(c(0, 1), size = 50, replace = TRUE), 
       waffle = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 20, sd = 4)) #<<
```

---

# Make Waffles more common in the South


Step 3: The arrow from South to Waffles, let's say Southern states have about 10 more Waffles, on average

```{r, echo = TRUE}
tibble(south = sample(c(0, 1), size = 50, replace = TRUE), 
       waffle = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 20, sd = 4) + 10 * south) #<<
```

---


# Simulate the outcome


Step 4: make a divorce rate, let's say about 20 divorces per 1,000 adults

```{r, echo = TRUE}
fake = tibble(south = sample(c(0, 1), size = 50, replace = TRUE), 
              waffle = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 20, sd = 4) + 10 * south,
              divorce = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 20, sd = 2)) #<<
```


---


# Make the South have more divorce


Step 5: the arrow from South to divorce, let's say southern states have about 8 more divorces per 1,000 residents

```{r, echo = TRUE}
fake = tibble(south = sample(c(0, 1), size = 50, replace = TRUE), 
              waffle = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 20, sd = 4) + 10 * south,
              divorce = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 20, sd = 2) + 8 * south) #<<
```

**NOTICE!** Waffles have no effect on divorce in our fake data

---

# A totally confounded relationship


The South's **effect** on Waffle House and on Divorce creates a **confounded** correlation between the two


```{r}
ggplot(fake, aes(x = waffle, y = divorce)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, fill = red, alpha = .8, shape = 21, color = "white") +

# 🧇 Your turn: confounded waffles 🧇


Make up data where a lurking variable creates a confounded relationship between two other variables that isn't truly causal:

.small[
1. Change the .yellow[confound], .blue[treatment] and .red[outcome] variables in the code to ones of your choosing

2. Alter the parameters in `rnorm()` so the values make sense for your variables

3. Make a scatterplot with a trend line -- use `labs()` to help us make sense of the plot axes and tell us what the confound is with the `title = ` argument in `labs()`

# What's going on here? 


.pull-left[
Think of causality as water flowing in the direction of the arrows


We want look at water flowing **directly** from a **treatment** to an **outcome**

But **account** for the fact that there is often *indirect* flow that *contaminates* our estimates

# What's going on here?



To **identify** the effect of Waffles on Divorce we need to **account**, or **control for**, the indirect flow resulting from South

Otherwise we will be *confounded*



```{r, out.width="80%"}
dagify(Divorce ~ South, 
       Waffle ~ South, 
       exposure = "Waffle",
       outcome = "Divorce", 
       coords = list(x = c(Waffle = 0, Divorce = 2, South = 1), 
                      y = c(Waffle = 0, Divorce = 0, South = 1))) %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) + theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(blue, red))
```

---


# The formula


1. Make a DAG of what we think is going on with our treatment and outcome

2. Figure out where the *indirect flows* are

3. Account for those in our analysis

# The second scenario


Say that Waffles do cause Divorce, but the effect is tiny: .0001

```{r, echo = TRUE}
fake = tibble(south = sample(c(0, 1), size = 50, replace = TRUE), 
              waffle = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 20, sd = 4) + 10*south,
              divorce = rnorm(n = 50, mean = 20, sd = 2) + 8*south + .0001 * waffle) #<<
```


---

# The second scenario


The effect of Z (South) on X (Waffles) and Y (Divorce) will **distort** our estimates:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
lm(divorce ~ waffle, data = fake) %>% tidy()
```


--

Estimate is `r .504/.0001` times larger than the true effect!


---

# Dealing with forks


We need to figure out what Z is, measure it, and **adjust for it** in our analysis


```{r, out.width="90%"}
dagify(Y ~ Z, 
       X ~ Z, 
       exposure = "X",
       outcome = "Y",

                      y = c(Y = 0, X = 0, Z = 1))) %>% 
  ggdag_dseparated() + theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```



---

# The perplexing pipe 🪠


X $\rightarrow$ Z $\rightarrow$ Y

X causes Z, which causes Y (or: Z *mediates* the effect of X on Y)

--


```{r, out.width="70%"}

       Z ~ X, 
       coords = list(x = c(X = -.5, Z = 0, Y = .5), 
                     y = c(Y = 0, Z = 0, X = 0))) %>%

What happens if we **adjust for Z**?  We **block** the effect of X on Y

# An example: foreign intervention


What effect does .blue[US foreign intervention] have on .red[US support abroad]?

Say the DAG looks like this:

  theme(legend.position = "none") + scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(blue, red))
```


If we control for *casualties* we are *blocking* the effect of intervention on support

---


# An example: foreign intervention


What if the DAG instead looked like this:

```{r}
dagify(Sentiment ~ Casualties + Intervention,

# An example: foreign intervention


Two ways that Intervention affects US sentiment: directly and indirectly

Just leave pipes alone! It's a problem of "over-adjusting"

--

Bad social science: sometimes we are so afraid of **forks** that we control for everything we have data on

--

Especially when a process seems very complicated


---


# Example: where pipes go wrong


The effects of **smoking** on **heart problems** might be complex; lots of potential confounds to worry about

--


Researcher might think they need to control for a study subject's **cholesterol**

--

"We should compare people who smoke but have similar levels of cholesterol, because cholesterol affects heart health"

---

# Example: where pipes go wrong



If the DAG looks like this, **cholesterol** is a pipe and controlling is bad!

--

```{r, out.width="80%"}
smoking_ca_dag = dagify(cardiacarrest ~ cholesterol,
                         cholesterol ~ smoking + weight,
                         smoking ~ unhealthy,
                         weight ~ unhealthy,
                         labels = c("cardiacarrest" = "Cardiac\n Arrest", 
                                    "smoking" = "Smoking",
                                    "cholesterol" = "Cholesterol",
                                    "unhealthy" = "Unhealthy\n Lifestyle",
                                    "weight" = "Fat content"),
                         exposure = "smoking",
                         outcome = "cardiacarrest")

ggdag_status(smoking_ca_dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) + theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(blue, red))
```

# The explosive collider 💥

$X \rightarrow Z \leftarrow Y$

--

X and Y have a common **effect**

--

Left alone, it's no problem; but **controlling for Z** creates strange patterns

--


```{r, out.width="70%"}
collider_triangle(x = "X", y = "Y", m = "Z") %>% 
  ggdag(use_labels = "label", text = FALSE, stylized = TRUE) + theme_dag()
```

# Example: the NBA


```{r,out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nba-height.png")
```

--


Should the NBA stop worrying about height when drafting players? 


---


# No!


Obviously, height helps in basketball

--

But **among NBA players** there might be no relationship between height and scoring, because shorter players have other advantages

--

**Among NBA players** = adjusting, or controlling for, being in the NBA

--

```{r, out.width="70%"}
dagify(Scoring ~ Height, 
       NBA ~ Scoring + Height, 
       exposure = "Height", 
       outcome = "Scoring",
       coords = list(x = c(Height = -.5, NBA = 0, Scoring = .5), 
                     y = c(Height = 0, NBA = -.5, Scoring = 0))) %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) + theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(blue, red))
```

# Another example: bad findings

# It's a collider


Imagine that in the world there is no relationship between how **surprising** a finding is and how **trustworthy** it is

--

```{r}
# simulate fake study selection data
n = 500 # number of studies
p = 0.1 # proportion of studies that get chosen
df = tibble(newsworthy = rnorm(n), 
            trustworthy = rnorm(n), 
            total = newsworthy + trustworthy, 
            top10 = quantile(total, probs = 1 - p), 
            published = ifelse(total >= top10, TRUE, FALSE))



ggplot(df, aes(x = newsworthy, y = trustworthy)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, fill = red, alpha = .8, shape = 21, color = "white") + 
  theme_nice() +
  labs(x = "How Surprising the Study is", 
       y = "How Trustworthy the Study is") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-2, 2), labels = c("Very unsurprising", "Very surprising")) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-2, 2), labels = c("Very untrustworthy", "Very trustworthy"))

```


---


# It's a collider


But now imagine that studies are only published **either** if they're *very trustworthy* OR *very surprising*


```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = newsworthy, y = trustworthy, fill = published)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = .8, shape = 21, color = "white") + 
  theme_nice() +
  labs(x = "How Surprising the Study is", 
       y = "How Trustworthy the Study is") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-2, 2), labels = c("Very unsurprising", "Very surprising")) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-2, 2), labels = c("Very untrustworthy", "Very trustworthy")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(red, blue)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```


---


# It's a collider


By only looking at *published papers* (e.g., **controlling for publication**), we create a negative relationship that doesn't exist


```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = newsworthy, y = trustworthy, fill = published)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = .8, shape = 21, color = "white") + 
  theme_nice() +
  labs(x = "How Surprising the Study is", 
       y = "How Trustworthy the Study is") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-2, 2), labels = c("Very unsurprising", "Very surprising")) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-2, 2), labels = c("Very untrustworthy", "Very trustworthy")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(red, blue)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top") + 
  geom_smooth(data = filter(df, published == TRUE), method = "lm")

# Exploding colliders


Like pipes, colliders are a problem of controlling for the wrong thing

They are often the result of a **sample selection** problem

They can **obscure** actual relationships or **fabricate** non-existent ones

We need to avoid controlling for colliders; but they are everywhere!


.pull-left[
```{r}
dagify(Scoring ~ Height, 
       NBA ~ Scoring + Height, 
       exposure = "Height", 
       outcome = "Scoring",
       coords = list(x = c(Height = -.5, NBA = 0, Scoring = .5), 
                     y = c(Height = 0, NBA = -.5, Scoring = 0))) %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) + theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(blue, red))
```
]


.pull-right[
```{r}
dagify(Published ~ Trustworth + Surprising, 
       exposure = "Surprising", 
       outcome = "Trustworth",
       coords = list(x = c(Surprising = -.5, Published = 0, Trustworth = .5), 
                     y = c(Surprising = 0, Published = -.5, Trustworth = 0))) %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name", stylized = TRUE) + theme_dag_blank() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(blue, red))

# 💥 Your turn: colliders 💥


How are the following examples of colliders?


1. Say that, on average, Google pays women less than men. But *comparing employees in the same type of job* (title, seniority, skills, etc.) the difference goes away, so there is no bias.

2. A study by Fryer (2019) on racial bias in policing finds that, *among people who are stopped by police*, white and non-white citizens are killed at the same rates, so there is no bias.
