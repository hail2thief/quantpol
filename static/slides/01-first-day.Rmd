## Not so fast

Groups that **are** decapitated are *different* from groups that **aren't** decapitated

`???` = Strength, resources, size, location, etc.

Ignoring these differences will **confound** our estimate of the effect of decapitation!

.pull-left[
- Ability to work with data ➡️ marketable

- R is popular in industry

- Familiarity with R ➡️ other languages

- Principles learned in R can be applied elsewhere (Excel)

- Problem-solving in Slack

> It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.
