# The feeling thermometer


We can use `summarise()` to measure average support for different groups:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
therm %>% 
  summarise(avg_police = mean(ft_police, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```


---

# Feeling thermometer


We can *compare* where support is highest and lowest:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
therm %>% 
  summarise(avg_police = mean(ft_police, na.rm = TRUE), 
            avg_muslim = mean(ft_muslim, na.rm = TRUE), #<<
            avg_white = mean(ft_white, na.rm = TRUE), #<<
            avg_immig = mean(ft_christ, na.rm = TRUE), #<<
            avg_fem = mean(ft_fem, na.rm = TRUE), #<<
            avg_black = mean(ft_black, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```

??? 
Patterns?

---

# The secret shortcut

```{r, echo = TRUE}
therm %>% 
  summarise(across(c(ft_black:ft_rep), ~mean(.,na.rm = TRUE))) #<<
```


You're not responsible for this!

---


# Breaking down support

We can look for patterns by using `group_by()` to separate average support *by* respondent characteristics:

--

.scroll-output[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
therm %>% 
  group_by(party_id) %>% #<<
  summarise(avg_police = mean(ft_police, na.rm = TRUE), avg_muslim = mean(ft_muslim, na.rm = TRUE), avg_white = mean(ft_white, na.rm = TRUE), avg_immig = mean(ft_christ, na.rm = TRUE), avg_fem = mean(ft_fem, na.rm = TRUE), avg_black = mean(ft_black, na.rm = TRUE))
```
]

???
Take code and iteratively change it
---


# Breaking down support

We can use `filter()` to focus our search on fewer categories: 

--

.scroll-output[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
therm %>% 
  filter(party_id %in% c("Democrat", "Republican", "Independent")) %>% #<<
  group_by(party_id) %>% 
  summarise(avg_police = mean(ft_police, na.rm = TRUE),avg_muslim = mean(ft_muslim, na.rm = TRUE), avg_white = mean(ft_white, na.rm = TRUE),avg_immig = mean(ft_christ, na.rm = TRUE),avg_fem = mean(ft_fem, na.rm = TRUE),avg_black = mean(ft_black, na.rm = TRUE))

# Making sense of the immigration gap

--

The problem with interpreting the immigration attitudes gap is that immigrants are disproportionately Democrat

--

How much of the difference we are observing across parties solely about **parties** and how much is it about *demographic* differences?

--

It might be, for instance, that the attitudes of non-migrants don't differ much across parties

--

that is, the big gap we see is all because immigrants are *both* more likely to be Democrats *and* have stronger views of own community

---

# Making sense of the migration gap

We can (very imperfectly with this data!) "test" this concern by breaking the data down further, by race: 

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
therm %>% 
  filter(party_id %in% c("Democrat", "Republican", "Independent")) %>%
  group_by(party_id, race) %>% #<<
  summarise(avg_imm = mean(ft_immig, na.rm = TRUE))
```


---


# Visualizing the pattern

We can create a new object to make a nice plot:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
therm_party_immig = therm %>% 
  filter(party_id %in% c("Democrat", "Republican", "Independent")) %>%
  filter(race %in% c("White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Asian", "Native American")) %>% 
  group_by(party_id, race) %>% #<<
  summarise(avg_imm = mean(ft_immig, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# The plot

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(therm_party_immig, aes(x = party_id, 
                              y = avg_imm, fill = race)) + 
  geom_col() #<<
```

---

# The better plot

`position = "dodge"` "unstacks" the columns

```{r,echo = TRUE, out.width="70%"}
ggplot(therm_party_immig, aes(x = party_id, 
                              y = avg_imm, fill = race)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") #<<
```

# The immigration attitudes gap

ggplot(therm_party_immig, aes(x = party_id, 
                              y = avg_imm, fill = race)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "rocket", end = .8) + 
  labs(x = "Party Identification", y = "Average thermometer level\nfor immigrants", fill = "Respondent race:") + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")

# Big picture


The immigration gap persists, even comparing non-immigrants against non-immigrants and immigrants against immigrants

--

Our analysis is a way of **accounting** for differences in groups (Democrats versus Republicans); it's closer to an "apples to apples" comparison


--


Big differences **across groups** should raise eyebrows; what's going on here? 

--

We can break the data down further to see what's going on beneath the surface

---

# Non-differences can be surprsing too


```{r, echo = TRUE}
therm %>% 
  summarise(avg_dems = mean(ft_dem, na.rm = TRUE), 
            avg_reps = mean(ft_rep, na.rm = TRUE))
```

--

Pretty neutral feelings; mass polarization is dead! Alert the media!!!

---

# Oh...

Breaking down data says something different

--

```{r}
therm %>% 
  group_by(party_id) %>% #<<
  summarise(dems = mean(ft_dem, na.rm = TRUE), 
            reps = mean(ft_rep, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# Negative polarization

```{r}
therm %>% 
  filter(party_id %in% c("Democrat", "Republican")) %>%

# Dummy variables

Often, *categorical* variables are coded 0/1 to represent "yes/no" or "presence/absence"

--

```{r}
pokemon %>%

  sample_n(10, weight = is_legendary) %>%

# Dummy proportions

--
When you take the average of a dummy variable you get a **proportion**:

--

Showered today? 1, 0, 0, 0, 1

--


Average of shower = $\frac{1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1}{5} = .40$

--

We can think about that proportion as a **probability** or **likelihood**

--

What is the **probability** a random student in class has showered? 2/5 = 40%

???
Convince yourself this is true

---

# Dummy variables


When you take the average of a dummy variable you get a proportion:

```{r}
pokemon %>% 
  summarise(prop_legendary = mean(is_legendary, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```

Approximately 8% of pokemon are legendary, or: 

--

there's an 8% **chance** a pokemon is legendary


???
Convince yourself this is true

---


# Dummy variables


Like with anything else, we can take averages by groups

--

For example, are creators making **more** legendary pokemon as time goes on to try to artificially make the show more exciting?

--

.scroll-output[
```{r,echo = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  group_by(generation) %>% #<<
  summarise(prop_legendary = mean(is_legendary, na.rm = TRUE))
```
]

---

# Dummy variables


We can store as an object, to make a plot:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
legend_gen = pokemon %>% #<<
  group_by(generation) %>% 
  summarise(prop_legendary = mean(is_legendary, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# Legendary pokemon over time

```{r,echo = TRUE, out.width = "90%"}
ggplot(legend_gen, aes(x = generation, y = prop_legendary)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "#324200")

2. How has the frequency with which Bob Ross included `clouds` in his paintings changed across the show's seasons? Make a time series to illustrate. 

3. If there is a `mountain` in a Bob Ross painting, how likely is it that mountain is *snowy*?

4. How much more likely was Steve Ross to paint a lake than his dad?

# Analyzing categorical variables

--

Some variables have values that are **categories** (race, sex, etc.)

--

Can't take the **mean** of a category!

--

But we *can* look at the *proportions* of observations in each category, and look for patterns there

---

# Pokemon types

How many Pokemon are there of each type? What are the most and least common types?


```{r}
pokemon %>% 
  select(name, type1) %>% 
  sample_n(10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

---

# Counting categories


We can use a new function `tally()`, in combination with `group_by()`, to **count** how many observations are in each category:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon
```

---


# Counting categories


We can use a new function `tally()`, in combination with `group_by()`, to **count** how many observations are in each category:

```{r, echo = TRUE}

# Counting categories

.scroll-output[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  group_by(type1) %>% 
  tally() #<<
```
]


---

# From counts to percents


We can can then use `mutate()` to calculate the **percent** in each group:

.scroll-output[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  group_by(type1) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n)) #<<
```
]


???
stop to show the n/sum(n)

---

# group_by + tally()


We can then store as object for plotting:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
type_pct = pokemon %>% #<<
  group_by(type1) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  mutate(percent = n/sum(n))
```

---

# group_by + tally()


We can then store as object for plotting:

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(type_pct, aes(x = type1, y = percent)) + 
  geom_col()
```

---

# group_by + tally()


Flip the coordinates for nicer plot:

```{r, echo = TRUE,out.width="80%"}
ggplot(type_pct, aes(x = type1, y = percent)) + 
  geom_col() + coord_flip() #<<
```

---


# group_by + tally()


Pro-tip: you can reorder the x-axis **by** another variable using `reorder()`

```{r, echo = TRUE,out.width="80%"}
ggplot(type_pct, aes(x = reorder(type1, percent), y = percent)) + #<<
  geom_col() + coord_flip()
```

---

# group_by + tally()

```{r}
ggplot(type_pct, aes(x = reorder(type1, percent), y = percent, fill = type1)) + #<<
  geom_col() + coord_flip() + theme_nice() + theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(x = "Type", y = "Percent of Pokemon") + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)

.small[
1. In a row of three seats, who should get to use the middle arm rest (`two_arm_rests`)? Make a barplot of the *percent* of respondents who gave each answer. 

2. In general, is it rude to knowingly bring unruly children on a plane? Make a barplot of the *percent* who gave each answer, but **separated by** whether the respondent has a kid or not. 

3. Make a barplot of responses to an etiquette dilemma of your liking. Bonus points if you break it down by a respondent characteristic.

> Okay If the data is accurate I fin it totally awesome that water type pokemon have the highest numbers when it comes to their total combined power. I always chose water type pokemon over any other and it is just great to see. 


> There was a burrito that I got after the last home game. I found that exciting. 

> I have highly confused about how to use the mutate and case_when functions and am struggling to apply them in the code.

> One thing that is pretty muddy is creating new variables and being able to use objects.
