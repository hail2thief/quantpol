# Why predict


We don't know what's going to happen in the **future**

--

Or in places/cases where we don't have data

--

Even if in cases where we have data -- what's our *best guess*? 

--


We can use **models** to make decisions informed by patterns in the data


---


# Prediction is for making decisions


World Bank: what would happen to Jamaica if their GDP went up by 10k?

--

Who the hell knows, but we can use models to make an educated **guess**

# First half of course


Use models to estimate the relationship between X and Y:


```r
mod = lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder)
tidy(mod)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 5
##   term         estimate std.error statistic   p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept) 54.0      0.315         171.  0        
## 2 gdpPercap    0.000765 0.0000258      29.7 3.57e-156

But is this relationship **causal**? Would an increase in GDP **cause** an increase in life expectancy, on average?

"How do we know if X **causes** y?"

Are our estimates **causal**? Academics fight about this all day!

We will also learn potential solutions

How do the two parts of our definition fit here?

.blue[Intervention] = someone **takes** aspirin, we administer aspirin, we sneak it into someone's food, etc.

.red[Probabilistic] = Taking aspirin doesn't work 100% of the time; but *in general*, *on average*, *more often than not*, etc., taking aspirin `\(\rightarrow\)` less fever

class: middle, center, inverse
# The trouble with causality

--

We can't directly observe a change in X **causing** a change in Y

--

This is true even in **experiments**, where we directly manipulate stuff

--

All we can see are **correlations** between X and Y

--

Some of those correlations **are** causal; some **are not**; how can we tell?

---


# First step: yes, we can tell (sometimes)

--

Students are obsessed with *"correlation does not mean causation"*

But sometimes it does! that's the tricky part

&lt;img src="images/sponge-cause.jpeg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---


## Make up (simulate) data to convince ourselves


A good way to see that we correlation **can** equal causation is to make up (**simulate**) data where we know that X causes Y

--


We can make up data in R with the `rnorm()` function

--

`rnorm()` draws random numbers from a **normal distribution**

--

This means: the numbers it makes up are pretty close to some **mean**, plus or minus a **standard deviation**

--

&gt; rnorm(n = 100, mean = 10, sd = 2)

Generate 100 random numbers, most of which are +/- 2 away from 10

---


# Do winners keep winning?

--

Say we wanted to simulate data to show that doing well in .blue[elections] (treatment) **causes** increases in .red[campaign funding] (outcome). That is, that funders seek out winners

--

First step is generating the .blue[treatment variable] (performance in elections). 

--

Let's say 500 fake elections that are pretty close to 50 (a tie), plus or minus 5 points


---

# Faking (simulating) the treatment


We can use `tibble()` to make a data object and `rnorm()` to generate the variables

--

.blue[Treatment variable] 500 elections, vote share is 50% of the vote on average, +/- 5%

--

.scroll-output[

```r
*fake_election = tibble(party_share = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 50, sd = 5))
fake_election
```

```
## # A tibble: 500 × 1
##    party_share
##          &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1        47.5
##  2        58.8
##  3        50.9
##  4        50.3
##  5        48.0
##  6        54.0
##  7        46.5
##  8        49.5
##  9        41.4
## 10        46.5
## # … with 490 more rows
```
]

---

# And we can plot it


&lt;img src="08-causality_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;


---


# Making the outcome


Next we want to make up the .red[outcome] (how much each party raises in funding)

--

Let's say parties raise about 20k on average, plus or minus 4k

--

.scroll-output[

```r
fake_election = tibble(party_share = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 50, sd = 5), 
*                      funding = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 20000, sd = 4000))
fake_election
```

```
## # A tibble: 500 × 2
##    party_share funding
##          &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1        54.5  23515.
##  2        55.8  22406.
##  3        52.0  20658.
##  4        49.6  14602.
##  5        45.5  22900.
##  6        56.7  21524.
##  7        49.4  15449.
##  8        50.4  18854.
##  9        54.6  18177.
## 10        54.0  17170.
## # … with 490 more rows
```
]


---


# Making X cause Y

--

Now let's say we wanted to make it so that getting more votes **increased** campaign donations (winners attract funding)

--

Say for every percent of the vote a party gets, they get 2,000 (USD) more in donations `\(\rightarrow\)` this is the causal effect of .blue[vote share] on .red[donations]

--

We can do that in R like so: 

.scroll-output[

```r
fake_election = tibble(party_share = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 50, sd = 5), 
*                      funding = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 20000, sd = 4000) + 2000*party_share)
fake_election
```

```
## # A tibble: 500 × 2
##    party_share funding
##          &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1        50.6 120186.
##  2        48.6 116252.
##  3        46.7 113977.
##  4        45.4 111470.
##  5        51.8 127143.
##  6        50.1 119179.
##  7        50.2 123414.
##  8        52.5 131026.
##  9        45.4 103973.
## 10        57.3 133077.

# Can we get the causal estimate back?

We **know** the effect of vote share on campaign donations: it's 2k per percent of the vote

--

Can we use a model to get that estimate back?

Yes!

lm(funding ~ party_share, data = fake_election) %&gt;% tidy()
```

.small[
1. Change the .blue[treatment] and .red[outcome] variables in the code to ones of your choosing

2. Alter the parameters in `rnorm()` so the values make sense for your variables

3. Make a scatterplot with a trend line -- use `labs()` to help us make sense of the plot axes!

# An example from IR

Does democracy reduce international conflict?

Theory: war is costly and the costs are borne by citizens; countries where citizens have more input `\(\rightarrow\)` less conflict

--

X here is .blue[whether the country is a democracy] (versus autocracy)

Y is .red[the number of wars the country is involved in]

--

Ideal, imaginary approach: take a country, look at Y when democracy = 1, and then when democracy = 0


--

Do this for all countries, take the average

# The fundamental problem of causality

--

We have missing data on "what would have happened" had the US been an autocracy

--

"what would have happened" `\(\rightarrow\)` the **counterfactual**

--


Our goal in causal inference is to make as good a guess as possible as to what Y would have been had democracy = 0 instead of 1 (and vice versa)


---

# Comparing apples and oranges


Why not just compare the number of wars for countries where democracy = 0 (autocracies) versus the countries where democracy = 1 (democracies)?

--

If democracies fight less, then democracy **reduces** conflict

--


```r
observed %&gt;% 
  group_by(democracy) %&gt;% 
  summarise(wars = mean(war, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 2
##   democracy  wars
##       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1         0     0
## 2         1     2
```

---


# Comparing apples and oranges


Implicitly, this means we are saying the countries that are *autocracies* are good **counterfactuals** for the countries that are democracies (and vice versa)

--

For instance, that China is a good counterfactual for the US

--

But China and the US are different in so many ways! They are not good **counterfactuals** of one another

--


We will see *exactly why* this is a problem in the following weeks

# Why experiments work

In an experiment, we *randomly* expose participants to some treatment, while others are exposed to nothing (or a placebo)

--


| Person|Shown an ad? | Democrats thermometer|
|------:|:------------|---------------------:|
|      1|Yes          |                  41.5|
|      2|No           |                 19.83|
|      3|Yes          |                 84.91|
|      4|No           |                 76.44|
|      5|No           |                 48.58|

--

We then compare the outcome of those who did and didn't get the treatment


---


# Why experiments work


Experiments have the same "problem" as the democracy and war example: we can't observe *the same person* seeing and not seeing the ad


| Person|Shown an ad? | Democrats thermometer|
|------:|:------------|---------------------:|
|      1|Yes          |                  41.5|
|      2|No           |                 19.83|


--

But since the experimental ad was *randomly* assigned, the people that did and didn't see the ad are good **counterfactuals** of one another

--

it is, **by definition**, just as likely a person who received treatment could have instead received the control/placebo (note how this differs from .blue[democracy] `\(\rightarrow\)` .red[war])


---

# The gold standard


This is why experiments are known as the **gold standard** of research

--

We have control over **treatment**, and we **randomize** it

--

With **observational data** that already exists in the world, we *don't* have control over treatment, and we *can't* randomize it

--

Experiments are great, but not feasible or ethical in most cases

--

So we'll have to take other measures to try to overcome these problems with observational data


---


# 🧩 Your turn: counterfactuals 🧩

1. A study on whether international trade between two countries makes them more likely to form a defensive alliance.


2. A study on whether being a victim of a crime makes someone more supportive of authoritarian leaders


3. A study on whether those who served in the military are more likely to vote for "dovish" or "hawkish" candidates
