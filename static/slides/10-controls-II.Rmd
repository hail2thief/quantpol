# The (fake) data


Go out and collect data on people who were and were not in gifted:


```{r}
fake_students = r_data_frame(n = 1000, name, age, grade) %>% 
  mutate(test = runif(n = n())*100) %>% 
  mutate(gifted = ifelse(test >= 75, "yes", "no")) %>% 
  mutate(earnings = rgamma(n = n(), 2) * 20000 - 25000 * I(gifted == "yes") +

# The problem


So many potential confounds, including ones that are really, really hard to measure (like .shout[ability]) and others that are .shout[unknown]


```{r}
dagify(earnings ~ gifted + family + location + ability + unknown, 
       gifted ~ family + location + ability + unknown, 
       exposure = "gifted", 
       outcome = "earnings", 
       latent = "ability") %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# The solution

.pull-left[
To get into gifted you typically need a certain score on an aptitude/IQ test

Imagine that the **cutoff** score is 75/100; above you're in gifted, below you are not

How was that cutoff chosen?

]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="70%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/phrenology.jpeg")
```

]


---



# The solution


The precise **cutoff** is completely arbitrary; could have been 74.5, or 76, or 80, or whatever

--

The *arbitrary* nature of the cutoff creates a **natural experiment**

--

A student who a 76 and a student who got a 34 are probably very different; if one makes more money than the other today, is that because of gifted? or other factors (.shout[ability]?)

--

But a student who got a 76 and one who got a 74 are probably interchangeable

--

Few points difference might be function of: .shout[random] error, luck, whatever


---


# The natural experiment


If we look *only* at students who scored close to the 75 cutoff we have the makings of a **natural experiment**

--

Around cutoff, essentially random whether you get treatment (gifted program) or not

--

“Natural experiments”: situations where some *thing* (often a rule) creates random assignment of treatment


---


# Looking around the cutoff


In analysis terms, (can be) simple: look only at students who scored close to 75, let's say +/- 2:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
subset_students = fake_students %>% 
  filter(test >= 73 & test <= 77) #<<
```


--

Then we estimate model on this group; let's also estimate in the full (confounded!) sample


```{r, echo = TRUE}
wrong_model = lm(earnings ~ gifted, data = fake_students)
discon_model = lm(earnings ~ gifted, data = subset_students)

```


---


# The results


Ouch! Looks like being in gifted actually **hurts** students in the long-run:

```{r}
huxreg("all students" = wrong_model, "students near cutoff" = discon_model, 
       statistics = "nobs")

# Visualize it

# Big picture


Natural experiments are "strongest" causal tool, and regression discontinuity designs are probably the most convincing approach


--

Easy to implement; less worry about confounding; the tough part? Finding one! And collecting the data

--

Often the result of some rule, boundary, or some other random, **arbitrary** process having a sudden impact in the world

--


Premium on: *specific* knowledge of a particular region/area/issue

# 🚨 Your turn: 🧠🧠🧠 🚨


With the person to your right (or whatever):

.small[
1. Write down as many rules, demarcations, cutoffs, etc., out there in the world that you can think of. 

2. Can any of these create an opportunity for a natural experiment, where *something* happens to some people/countries/places but not to others as a result of this rule/cutoff/thing? 

3. What problem could that natural experiment help solve? In the gifted program case: the IQ test cutoff helps solve the problem of estimating the effect of gifted programs on future success. 

4. Post a summary in the Slack and if the idea is good enough I will steal it and publish it.

# No free lunch

--

Natural experiments are great but there is still reason to worry

--

If we find a good one, the thing we are trying to estimate might *unexpectedly* change (is this bad? depends)

--

People are **strategic**; if there's a rule out there that has consequences, they will do what they can to end up on the right side of it

---


# Limitations: changing estimates


By focusing on units near cutoff, our estimate subtly changes: 

--

* ~~effect of putting *a child* in gifted on future earnings~~

--

* effect of putting a child *with roughly 75 IQ* in gifted on earnings ✅


```{r, out.width="70%"}
ggplot(fake_students, aes(x = test, y = earnings, 
                          color = gifted)) +

```

# Limitations: "sorting around the cutoff"


There is also a risk that if people *know* about the cutoff they will behave strategically in ways that **confound our estimate** 

--

Imagine that there is room to pressure/bully the school psychologist into turning a 74.9 into a 75 so little Timmy can be gifted

--


And image wealthier/better-connected/etc parents are better bullies than poor parents

--

In that case, being gifted is no longer as-if random for those close to the cutoff -- wealthy parents **cause** you to get over the cutoff


---


# Sorting around the cut-off


If parents can force almost-there kids into gifted, parents become a **backdoor path to earnings** (since your parents likely affect your earnings directly, or in other ways)


```{r, out.width="90%"}
dagify(earnings ~ gifted + parents, 
       gifted ~ parents, 
       exposure = "gifted", 
       outcome = "earnings") %>% 
  ggdag_status(text = FALSE, use_labels = "name") + theme_dag() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


---


# 🚨 Your turn: sorting around the cutoff 🚨


Think back to the arbitrary cutoff you came up with in the last exercise. Discuss again with your neighbor:


1. Could someone "game" or sort around that cutoff? 
2. What would that look like? 
3. And how could it confound your estimate / ruin the natural experiment?
