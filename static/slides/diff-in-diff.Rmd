# New policies: natural experiments?


Can we think of the the passage of a new policy as a kind of **natural experiment**? 

--

In some ways no: the countries/states that adopt a policy (e.g., abortion bans) are **very different** from the states that don't pass them

# New policies: natural experiments?


But in some ways maybe *yes*: the policy didn't exist, and then suddenly it does

--

There can be factors that make the policy more likely: e.g., a cash transfer (Biden bucks) are more likely during an economic downturn than during good times

--

But some policies are sudden or unexpected enough where the **exact** moment they go into effect is *arbitrary*

---

# Difference-in-difference

This is where the **difference-in-difference (DiD)** research design comes into play

--

One of the most commonly used (and maybe abused) methods for **estimating the effect of a policy (or sudden change) on an outcome**


--

General idea: try to simulate *what would have happened* in the places that received a policy/shock, using what happened in the places that *didn't* receive the shock over the same time period

---

# The setup

We observe **units** (e.g., states) over **time**


Some units experience some policy or shock (the **treatment group**), and we observe them *before* and *after* the shock


Some units *never* experience the policy (the **control group**) and we also observe them *before* and *after* the shock

---

# The setup

```{r}
set.seed(1990)

tibble(abb = sample(state.name, size = 10)) %>% 
  mutate(treated = rbinom(n = n(), size = 1, prob = .5)) %>% 
  crossing(year = 1990:2010) %>% 
  mutate(onset = year > 2002, 
         treat_onset = treated * onset) %>% 
  mutate(turnout = rnorm(n = n())) %>% 
  panelview(turnout ~ treat_onset, pre.post = TRUE,

# The effect of Pokemon Go!

--

Pokemon Go! involves a ton of walking around

--

Did Pokemon Go! meaningfully **increase** Americans' activity levels? 

--

Seems obvious, but by how much exactly?


---


# The setup 

--

We have kids who download the app when it comes out (**treatment**)

--

We have kids who never download the app (**control**)

--

We have data on both of these groups of kids **before** and **after** the app is released

---

# Problems

.pull-left[
If we compare treated against controls, we worry about backdoor paths between having the app and amount of walking

If we compare before and after the app comes out, is this because of the app or random fluctuations in walking?
]


.pull-right[
```{r}
dagify(Y ~ X + H + A,
       X ~ H + A, 
       exposure = "X", outcome = "Y", 
       labels = c(Y = "Walking", X = "PokemonGo!", 
                  H = "Natural changes over time", 
                  A = "Reasons for having app"),
       coords = list(x = c(X = 0, A = .5, H = .5, Y = 1), 
                     y = c(X = 0, A = 1, H = -1, Y = 0))) %>%

  scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red, yellow)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(blue, red, yellow))
```

]

---

# The DiD approach

--

One thing we can do is look at what happens to the kids in the treatment group (those who downloaded the app), *before and after* the app was released

--

The change from before to after will include the effect of the app + the time fluctuations we are worried about

--

We can then compare to what happens with the kids in the control group (never download the app) -- change from before to after will **only include** the time fluctuations

--

This is the **DiD** approach: the change in the control group is our counterfactual for *what would have happened* had the treated kids never been treated


---

# Treated units, before and after the app


Among **treated**, kids go from walking 0.8 miles a day to 1.6, so an improvement of 0.8 miles on average. Is this just because of the app?

```{r}
pokemon = crossing(time = c("Before app comes out",
                          "After app comes out"),
                 unit = c("App users", 
                          "Non-app users")) %>% 
  arrange(unit, time) %>% 
  mutate(walking = c(1.6, 0.8, .9, .6),
         time = fct_rev(time))

ggplot(filter(pokemon, unit == "App users"), 
       aes(x = time, y = walking, group = unit)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, color = red) + 
  geom_line(size = 2, color = red) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 2)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Average walking distance (miles)") +

             color = red, size = 4, fontface = "bold")
```

---


# Control units, before and after app


Among **control**, kids go from walking 0.6 miles a day to 0.9 miles -- and we *know* this isn't because of the app -- this is just the *time trend*

```{r}

ggplot(filter(pokemon, unit == "App users"), 
       aes(x = time, y = walking, group = unit)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, color = red) +

  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 2)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Average walking distance (miles)") +

             color = blue) +

                 label = "Change in walking:\n0.9 - 0.6 = 0.3"), 
             color = blue, size = 4, fontface = "bold")
```

# The counterfactual


So what would have happened to the **treated** kids if they had never downloaded the app? We can use the time trend from the control group as our **counterfactual**


```{r}
ggplot(filter(pokemon, unit == "App users"), 
       aes(x = time, y = walking, group = unit)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, color = red) +

  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 2)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Average walking distance (miles)") + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 14)) + 
  geom_point(data = filter(pokemon, unit == "Non-app users"), 
             aes(x = time, y = walking, group = unit), size = 4, 
             color = blue) + 
  geom_line(data = filter(pokemon, unit == "Non-app users"), 
             aes(x = time, y = walking, group = unit), size = 2, 
            color = blue) + 
  annotate(geom = "segment", x = "Before app comes out", 
           xend = "After app comes out", 
           y = pokemon$walking[2], 
           yend = pokemon$walking[2] + 0.3, size = 2, lty = 2) + 
  geom_point(data = tibble(x = "After app comes out", 
                           y = pokemon$walking[2] + 0.3),

# The DiD estimate


Wages were actually *higher* than we would expect given changes in other cities

In other words, migration seems to have **improved** wages, or reduced the impact of the economic downturn

# When does this work?


The nice thing about DiD is that we don't need treatment and control to be exchangeable (as with discontinuity designs) -- eg, the kids who download the app are more active from the get go than kids who never get the app


```{r}
ggplot(filter(pokemon, unit == "App users"), 
       aes(x = time, y = walking, group = unit)) + 
  geom_point(size = 4, color = red) + 
  geom_line(size = 2, color = red) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 2)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Average walking distance (miles)") + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 14)) + 
  geom_point(data = filter(pokemon, unit == "Non-app users"), 
             aes(x = time, y = walking, group = unit), size = 4, 
             color = blue) + 
  geom_line(data = filter(pokemon, unit == "Non-app users"), 
             aes(x = time, y = walking, group = unit), size = 2, 
            color = blue) + 
  annotate(geom = "segment", x = "Before app comes out", 
           xend = "After app comes out", 
           y = pokemon$walking[2], 
           yend = pokemon$walking[2] + 0.3, size = 2, lty = 2) + 
  geom_point(data = tibble(x = "After app comes out", 
                           y = pokemon$walking[2] + 0.3), 
             aes(x = x, y =y), 
             inherit.aes = FALSE, size = 4) + 
  annotate(geom = "segment", x = "After app comes out", 
           xend = "After app comes out", 
           y = pokemon$walking[2] + 0.3, 
           yend = pokemon$walking[1], size = 2, color = yellow) + 
  geom_label(aes(x = 2.3, y = 1.3, label = "The Pokemon Go! effect:\n1.6 - 1.1 = .5"),
             color = yellow, fontface = "bold")

# Parallel trends

--

The key assumption we are making with DiD is that had the treatment not happened (e.g., had Mariel not happened), the treatment units (Miami) and control units (other cities) would **look the *same**

--

What we need for this assumption to work is for **treatment** and **control** units to have similar trends over time

--

This is called the *parallel trends assumption*. We can look at **pre-treatment** trends to evaluate how good this assumption is


---


# Parallel trends


Below the trends looks very good -- prior to treatment, control and treated units behave similarly


```{r}
tibble(date = seq(ymd("2018-01-01"), ymd("2020-01-01"), by = "months")) %>% 
  mutate(treated = rnorm(n = n(), mean = 500, sd = 30) + .0005 + year(date), 
         control = treated + 200) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -date, names_to = "status", values_to = "outcome") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = outcome, color = status)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.5) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(2400, 2800), 
                  xlim = c(ymd("2018-01-01"), ymd("2021-06-01"))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = ymd("2020-01-01"), size = 2, lty = 2, 
             color = yellow) + 
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Outcome", color = "Treatment status:") + 
  theme(legend.position = "top") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red)) + 
  geom_label(aes(x = ymd("2020-04-01"), y = 2600,
                 label = "Treatment \ngoes into effect"), 
             color = yellow, fontface = "bold")
```

# Parallel trends


This looks 🤢 -- prior to treatment, treated and control behave very differently. The control unit trend is *not a good counterfactual* for the treated unit trend


```{r}
set.seed(19242)
tibble(date = seq(ymd("2018-01-01"), ymd("2020-01-01"), by = "months")) %>% 
  mutate(treated = rnorm(n = n(), mean = 500, sd = 30) + .0005 + year(date), 
         control = rnorm(n = n(), mean = 500, sd = 30) + 200 + .0005 + year(date)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -date, names_to = "status", values_to = "outcome") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = outcome, color = status)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.5) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(2400, 2800), 
                  xlim = c(ymd("2018-01-01"), ymd("2021-06-01"))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = ymd("2020-01-01"), size = 2, lty = 2, 
             color = yellow) + 
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Outcome", color = "Treatment status:") + 
  theme(legend.position = "top") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(blue, red)) + 
  geom_label(aes(x = ymd("2020-05-01"), y = 2600,
                 label = "Treatment \ngoes into effect"), 
             color = yellow, fontface = "bold")

# Recap


We know that to identify the effect of a .red[treatment] on an .blue[outcome] we need to worry about confounds

--

With a good DAG and good controls, we might make it to the promised land, but this is **hard**

--

But sometimes Nature (or History) is kind and gives us moments that **resemble experiments**

--

Discontinuities, where to treatment is as-if random, conditional on **the cutoff being respected**

--

Sudden policies/shocks, where DiD can identify their effect, conditional on treatment and control units **having parallel trends**

# 🗺️ A hard left turn 🗺️


We're going to randomly make maps now Using the code from today:

1. Make a map of US counties, "filling" the counties with a variable of your choice.

2. Add nice color to the graph, using `scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "rocket")` if your fill data is discrete, and `scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "rocket")` if continuous

3. Repeat but subset the data to a state of your choosing. 

4. Post the map in the Slack.
