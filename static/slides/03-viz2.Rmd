# A graph for every season

--

There are many graphs out there

--


Each one works best in a specific **context**

--


Each one combines different **aesthetics** and **geometries**


---

class: center, middle
# Key plotting questions

--

What am I trying to **show**?

--

(a distribution, a relationship, a comparison)

--

What **kind** of variables do I have? 

--

(continuous, discrete, something in between)

--

What **aesthetics** and **geometries** do I need for this plot? 

--

(x-axis, y-axis, color, size, shape, etc.)

---


# What kind of variable do I have? 

--

- Continuous: takes on lots of values (GDP, population, income, age, etc.)

--


- Discrete: takes on a few values, often "qualitative" (yes/no, 1/0, race, etc.)

--


It all depends on your data! 



---

# Graph 1 - the scatterplot


```{r,out.width="80%"}
ggplot(gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() + 
  annotate(geom = "rect", xmin = 8500, xmax = 15000, ymin = 48, ymax = 58, 
           fill = red, alpha = .4)
```


The **scatterplot** visualizes the relatioship between two **continuous** variables


Shows every point in the data, reveals *outliers*







---


# The grammar of scatterplots



```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
df = tribble(~Data, ~Aesthetic, ~Geometry, 
             "One variable", "`x`", "`geom_point()`", 
             "Another variable", "`y`", "`geom_point()`")
knitr::kable(df)
```


--


Typically, we put the **cause** on the x-axis and the **effect** on the y-axis

--


We can add other aesthetics (color, shape, size, etc.)


---




## Scatterplots are for *continuous* variables


```{r,out.width="80%"}
ggplot(gap_07, aes(x = continent, y = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

--

Plot is mostly uninformative because continent is *discrete* (i.e., a category)


---

# Graph 2: the time series


```{r,out.width="80%",echo = FALSE}
ggplot(life_yr, aes(x = year, y = avg_yrs)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.8, color = red) +  #<<
  theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average life expectancy (years)",
       title = "Global average life expectancy over time")
```

The **time series** uses a *line* to show you how a variable (y-axis) moves over time (x-axis)

---


## Mapping data to aesthetics

.pull-left[
```{r}
knitr::kable(life_yr)
```
]


.pull-right[
```{r}
tribble(~Data, ~`aes()`, ~`geom_`,
          "??", "??", "??") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

]


---


## Making the time series

.pull-left[
```{r,echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(life_yr, aes(x = year, `y = avg_yrs`)) +
  `geom_line()`
```

```{r,echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(life_yr, aes(x = year, y = avg_yrs)) +
  geom_line() #<<
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
tribble(~Data, ~`aes()`, ~`geom_`,
          "year", "x", "line",
        "avg_yrs", "y", "line") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

# 🚨 Your turn: 💸Recession💸 🚨

--

Look at the `economics` dataset from the `tidyverse` package

--

Type and run `economics` to see the data

--

Type and run `?economics` to read about the data

--

Make a time series of unemployment over time

--

Can you identify the recessions?

## Multiple time series


Sometimes we observe multiple *units* over time; how can we visualize these?


.scroll-output[
```{r}
gapminder_sample = 
  gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Bolivia", "China", "Germany", "United States", "Denmark", 
                        "Ghana", "Egypt"))
knitr::kable(gapminder_sample)
```
]


---



# Start from scratch

```{r,echo =TRUE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_sample) #<<
```

---


# Add aesthetics

```{r,echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_sample, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) #<<
```

---

# Add geometry: 🤢

```{r,echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = gapminder_sample, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line()
```

---

# using `color` to separate lines

```{r,echo=TRUE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = gapminder_sample, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp,
                                  color = country)) + #<<
  geom_line()
```

---


# using `group` to separate lines

```{r,echo=TRUE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = gapminder_sample, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp,
                                  group = country)) + #<<
  geom_line()
```

---



# Multiple time series

```{r,out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = gapminder_sample, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp,
                                  color = country)) + #<<
  geom_line(size = 1.4) + theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans Condensed")
```


These are useful for comparing **trends** across units (countries, places, people, etc)


---


# Graph 3: the histogram


```{r, echo = FALSE,out.width="60%"}
ggplot(gap_07, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram() + #<<
  theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans") +
  labs(x = "Life expectancy (years)")
```

A **histogram** shows you how a continous variable is *distributed*

--

Popular in social sciences -- can tell you a lot about a variable!

---


# Interpreting histograms


```{r}
gap_07 %>% 
  select(lifeExp, gdpPercap, pop) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = name)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(name), scales = "free") + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

???

What do we see here? 

---


# Making the histogram


.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE,out.width="60%"}
ggplot(gap_07, aes(x = lifeExp)) + #<<
  geom_histogram() + #<<
  theme_bw()
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
tribble(~Data, ~`aes()`, ~`geom_`,
          "continuous variable", "x", "histogram") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
]


Note that a histogram *only* uses the x-axis!


---


# Grouped histograms


```{r, echo = TRUE,out.width="60%"}
ggplot(gap_07, aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) + #<<
  geom_histogram() + theme_bw()
```

--

Just like with the grouped time series, we can do grouped histograms

--

Allows us to compare distributions of different *groups* or units


???
What does this plot show us?

# 🚨 Your turn: organs 🫁🧠 🚨 


--

Grab the `organdata` dataset 

--

Make a histogram of country's organ donation rate (`donors`)

--

Then make a grouped histogram, where groups are defined by whether donors have to opt in or opt out of donating (`opt`)

--

What happens if instead of using `fill` you use `color`?

--


```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 5L)
```

# Graph 4: the barplot


```{r,out.width="80%"}
tv = gss_cat %>% 
  group_by(marital) %>% 
  summarise(tv = mean(tvhours, na.rm = TRUE)) 

ggplot(tv, aes(x = fct_reorder(marital, tv), y = tv)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(y = "Average hours of tv watched per day", 
       x = NULL, title = "TV and marriage in the USA") + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans")
```


Barplots place a *category* (place, country, person, etc) on one axis and a *quantity* (amount, average, median, etc.) on another

--

Useful for making **comparisons**, highlighting **differences**

???

Causal difference between married and widowed? theory?

---

# Mapping the barplot


.pull-left[
```{r}
knitr::kable(select(tv, marital, tv), 
                    digits = 1)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
tribble(~Data, ~`aes()`, ~`geom_`,
          "marital", "x", "col",
        "tv", "y", "col") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

]

---

# Making the barplot


```{r,echo = TRUE}
ggplot(tv, aes(x = marital, y = tv)) + #<<
         geom_col() #<<
```


---


## Flip the coordinates with `coord_flip()` for cleaner view


```{r,echo = TRUE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(tv, aes(x = marital, y = tv)) +
         geom_col() + coord_flip() #<<
```


---

exclude: false
# Barplot: too many groups 🤢


```{r, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(gap_07, aes(x = country, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_col()
```


Barplots are good for comparing averages, medians, etc., across a *small* number of units


---

# Graph 5: the boxplot


```{r, out.width="80%"}
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, 
             y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = NULL, 
       title = "Distribution of life expectancy across continents") + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


Boxplots compare the **distributions** of *continuous* variables across groups - they show us *more* than the barplot which only gives us a quantity for each group

---


# Compare distributions: the boxplot


.pull-left[
Boxplots contain a lot of info 🥵:

- bold line is the **median** observation
- box is the middle 50% of observations
- thin vertical lines show you min and max value, *except...*
- the dots, which are **outlier** observations
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, 
             y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = NULL, 
       title = "Distribution of life expectancy across continents") + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
]

# Mapping the boxplot


.pull-left[
```{r}
knitr::kable(select(gapminder, country, continent, lifeExp))

.pull-right[
```{r}
tribble(~Data, ~`aes()`, ~`geom_`,

# The five(-ish) graphs


```{r}
tribble(~Graph, ~`aes()`, ~`geom_`, ~Purpose,

        "Boxplot", "x = category, y = cont. variable", "boxplot()", "Compare distributions") %>%

```


Know how and when to use which!

# Making graphs pretty (or ugly)

--

There's a million other aesthetics, geometries, and layers in `ggplot()`

--

Some can make graphs better, others worse

--

Here are some of my favorite ones

---


# Showing movement using `facet_wrap()`


```{r, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(year)) +  #<<
  theme_minimal()
```


You can break out a plot into multiple panels using the `facet_wrap()` layer

Shows *movement* of a variable across time, space, etc.

---

# Using facet_wrap

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

---

# Using facet_wrap

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(vars(year)) #<<
```


Make sure the facetting variable is wrapped in `vars()`!


---


# Make aesthetics static within the geometries


```{r,echo = TRUE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + theme_light() + 
  geom_point(size = 4, color = "orange", shape = 2) #<<
```


Take your aesthetics out of `aes()` and into `geom()` to make them *static*


---

exclude: true

# Show a trend-line using `geom_smooth()`


```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(evals, aes(x = age, y = score)) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw() + labs(x = "Professor age", y = "Student evals") + 
  geom_smooth() #<<
```

Trend lines can reveal patterns in "clumpy" data

---

exclude: true
# Show *separate* trend-lines


```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(evals, aes(x = age, y = score, color = gender)) + #<<
  geom_point() + theme_bw() + labs(x = "Professor age", y = "Student evals") + 
  geom_smooth() #<<
```


Relationships can look different *within* groups


---


# Ridge plots (better than grouped histograms)


```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="70%"}
library(ggridges)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(y = continent, x = lifeExp)) + 
    geom_density_ridges() #<<
```

Ease visual comparison + kinda looks like the Joy Division album

---


# Beeswarm plots (alternative boxplots)


```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="60%"}
library(ggbeeswarm)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +  
    geom_quasirandom() #<<
```

Beeswarm plots tell us something boxplots don't: the number observations by group; used recently by the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/11/nyregion/hasidic-yeshivas-schools-new-york.html)

---



# Use different color and fill scales


```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues") #<<
```


`fill_brewer()` for `fill`, `color_brewer` for `color`


---


# My favorite scale (right now)

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "magma") #<<
```


`_d` for *discrete* variables, `_c` for continuous


---


# Many other themes

```{r,out.width="80%"}
library(tvthemes)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) + 
  geom_histogram() + theme_spongeBob() + labs(title = "Horrible") + 
  scale_fill_spongeBob()
```

`theme_spongeBob()` from `tvthemes` package, many more online
