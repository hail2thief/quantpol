# Data, objects, variables

--

Objects are one of the most confusing parts of coding for new programmers

--

An **object** is a "thing" that lives in R that we can use; think of the pantry metaphor!

--

In this class, 99.99% of objects are just **data**

--

Data has **variables** which are represented as columns

--

Objects ➡️ Data ➡️ Variables

---

# Example: pokemon

Once you load the `pokemon` data in your homework, it becomes an object; you can tell it's an object because: 

--

1. it shows up in the top-right screen (the "environment")
2. when you type it out and run it in R you can see the contents

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon
```

---


# Objects have variables


Columns like `type1` are *variables*


```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon
```

---


# Altering objects

You can do stuff to objects, like subset based on rules (using `filter()`), creating new **variables** (with `mutate()`), etc. 

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  filter(type1 == "grass") %>% 
  mutate(height_mm = height_m * 1000)
```


---

# Nothing changed


But notice that the original pokemon data remains unchanged!

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon
```

---


# Why? 

--

The reason is because we did not *store* the changes we made as a new **object**

--

Stored: 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
grass_pokemon = pokemon %>% 
  filter(type1 == "grass") %>% 
  mutate(height_mm = height_m * 1000)
```

Not stored:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
pokemon %>% 
  filter(type1 == "grass") %>% 
  mutate(height_mm = height_m * 1000)
```


---


# Storing our changes as objects

Whenever we want to *alter* an object and *keep track* of those changes, we have to store them as a new object

```{r, echo = TRUE}
grass_pokemon
```

---


# Confused by the name

--

Objects are **different** from variables! Objects **contain** variables!

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
total_power = pokemon %>% 
  mutate(total_power = hp + attack + defense + speed)
```

Here, there is an **object** called "total_power" that contains a variable called "total_power"

--

So confusing! Don't do this! Choose a different name!

--

If a HW problem says "make a variable called Joe" don't store the changes as an object called "Joe"!

# Tortured metaphor: making a movie


.pull-left[

- Coding is like making a movie

- You can write a movie script ("code") that has all the steps to produce a scene ("data analysis"): 
    - stand here, say this, move there, wear that
    - filter this, mutate that
- But if you don't hit **record** ("store as an object") you won't capture any of it

# Summarizing data

--
Often, with data, we want to **compare** things

--

Are democracies more peaceful than autocracies? Does early-voting increase turnout? Are decapitated terrorist groups weaker?

--

To do this, we often rely on **statistical summaries** of our data: 

--

Means, medians, minimums, maximums, variances

---

class: center, middle
# Summary stats

--

The *mean*: 3, 4, 8 $\rightarrow$ $\frac{(3 + 4 + 8)}{3} = 5$

--

The *median*: 3, **4**, 8 $\rightarrow$ 4

--

The *minimum*: **3**, 4, 8 $\rightarrow$ 3

--

The *maximum*: 3, 4, **8** $\rightarrow$ 8


---


# Example: an experiment


Some counties let people vote **early**; others don't

--

Do counties with early provisions have **higher** turnout? 

---


# The data

.scroll-output[
```{r}
set.seed(1990)
fake = tibble(`Vote early?` = sample(x = c("Yes", "No"), size = 3000, 
                              replace = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(`Turnout (%)` = rnorm(n = 3000, mean = 40 + 10*I(`Vote early?` == "Yes"), sd = 5))

knitr::kable(head(fake, n = 100), align = "cc")
```
]


---


# Quantifying "higher"


We can compare the *averages* of counties that do have early voting against those that don't:

--

```{r}
fake %>% 
  group_by(`Vote early?`) %>% 
  summarise(`Average turnout` = mean(`Turnout (%)`)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

--

Counties with early voting have, **on average**, 10 percentage points higher turnout


---

# Mean vs. median


We almost always compare averages, but medians are helpful in some cases:

--

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
set.seed(1990)
fake = tibble(income = rexp(n = 500, rate = .005)) %>% 
  mutate(income = income * 1000)

ggplot(fake, aes(x = income)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = red, alpha = .8) + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans") + 
  labs(title = "Fake distribution of household income in the US", 
       x = NULL, y = NULL) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(fake$income), 
             lty = 2, 
             size = 2, 
             color = yellow) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(fake$income), 
             lty = 2, 
             size = 2, 
             color = blue) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 500000, y = 75,
                label = glue::glue("median: {scales::dollar(round(median(fake$income), 0))}")), 
            color = blue, family = "Fira Sans", size = 5) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 500000, y = 65,
                label = glue::glue("mean: {scales::dollar(round(mean(fake$income), 0))}")), 
            color = yellow, family = "Fira Sans", size = 5)
```

What's happening here?

class: middle, center
# One more stat: variation

--

Another way to compare data is by how much a variable *varies*

--

Some distributions are very *narrow*, others are very *wide*

--

Narrow = observations are similar; wide = observations are not similar

---

# Measuring variation: the standard deviation


If you're interested in the formula here it is: 

$$ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}$$

--

But in human terms, the *bigger* the standard deviation the *wider* the distribution

---



# Measuring variation


Same average (~$50,000) different **standard deviations**


```{r}
fake = tibble(`narrow, sd = $5,000` = rnorm(n = 200, mean = 50, sd = 5), 
              `wide, sd = $10,000` = rnorm(n = 200, mean = 50, sd = 10), 
              `very wide, sd = $20,000` = rnorm(n = 200, mean = 50, sd = 20)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  mutate(value = value * 1000, 
         name = factor(name, levels = c("narrow, sd = $5,000", 
                                        "wide, sd = $10,000",
                                        "very wide, sd = $20,000")))

ggplot(fake, aes(x = value, fill = name)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white", alpha = .8) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(name)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans", base_size = 14) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "rocket", end = .8) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Household income across three fake towns")

# Summary statistics with `summarize()`


We can use `summarize()` to **calculate** things like the mean, median, etc.


```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/summarize.png")
```

---

# Using `summarize()`


Say I want to know the average life expectancy in the world in 2007:

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) #<<
```

---


# Using `summarize()`


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize() #<<
```

---

# Using `summarize()`


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(avg_life = mean(lifeExp)) #<<
```


Notice! how the data has been *summarized*: only one row!


---

# Using `summarize()`


What if I also wanted to know the **median** life expectancy?

--


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(avg_life = mean(lifeExp), 
            med_life = median(lifeExp)) #<<
```


Notice! how similar this looks to `mutate()`

---

# Using `summarize()`


What if I also wanted to know the **min** and **max** life expectancy?

--


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(avg_life = mean(lifeExp), 
            med_life = median(lifeExp), 
            min_life = min(lifeExp), 
            max_life = max(lifeExp))
```

---

# Using `summarize()`


What if I also wanted to know the **standard deviation** of life expectancy?

--


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(avg_life = mean(lifeExp), 
            med_life = median(lifeExp), 
            min_life = min(lifeExp), 
            max_life = max(lifeExp), 
            sd_life = sd(lifeExp))
```

---

# Using `summarize()`


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(avg_life = mean(lifeExp), #<<
            med_life = median(lifeExp), #<<
            min_life = min(lifeExp), #<<
            max_life = max(lifeExp), #<<
            sd_life = sd(lifeExp)) #<<
```

--

`summarize()` is like `mutate()` in that you are creating *new variables*

--

So note that you have to *name* the new variables!

# Bane of my existence: missing data

--

In life, sometimes data is **missing**: respondent doesn't answer a question, no one knows how much wheat England produced in 1823, etc.

--

R represents missing data as **NA**

--

```{r}
pokemon %>% 
  filter(is.na(height_m)) %>% 
  select(name, type1, type2, height_m, weight_kg) %>% 
  sample_n(10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

---

# Bane of my existence: missing data


If you try to *summarize* data that has missing values, R will return `NA`:

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  summarise(average_height = mean(height_m))
```

---

# Bane of my existence: missing data

--

There are whole classes on what to do with missing data

--

In this class we will tell R to ignore missing observations, by adding `na.rm = TRUE` to our summary function

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  summarise(average_height = mean(height_m, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```

---

# Bane of my existence: missing data

--

If you're trying to calculate a summary statistic and keep getting `NA`...

--

99.99999% of the time you need to add `na.rm = TRUE` to your function!

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  summarise(average_height = mean(height_m, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```

---

# 🚨 Your turn: elections 🚨


1. What is the average, minimum, and maximum percent of the vote that Republicans won in 2016? Bonus: where was that min and max? 

--

2. How many people live in the median county in Florida? 

--

3. Which *region* has the biggest variation in the land area of its counties?

--

4. 🔥**Semi-fire challenge**🔥: Compare the mean and median percent of the population that is Black and white, respectively. Why is the mean larger than the median in one case *but the opposite* in the other? Use plots to illustrate the point.


```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 10L)
```

---

# Relationships

--
`summarize()` lets us calculate the min, max, median, mean, sd, etc., across the whole dataset

--

But what if we want to do this for different *groups* within the data? 

--

This is at the heart of making **comparisons**!

# Life expectancy over time: the brutal way

Need to find the average life expectancy in the world *in each* year that we have data

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1952) %>% #<< 
  summarise(avg_life = mean(lifeExp)) #<<
```


---

# Life expectancy over time: the brutal way

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1957) %>% #<< 
  summarise(avg_life = mean(lifeExp)) #<<
```


---

# Life expectancy over time: the brutal way

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1962) %>% #<< 
  summarise(avg_life = mean(lifeExp)) #<<
```


---


# 😍: Using `group_by()`


We can use `group_by()` in combination with `summarize()` to calculate some stat **by** another variable in the data: 

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% #<<
  summarise(avg_life = mean(lifeExp))
```

---

# Using `group_by()`


Like with anything else, we can store our results as a new object: 


```{r, echo = TRUE}
life_year = gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>% #<<
  summarise(avg_life = mean(lifeExp))
```

---

# Life expectancy over time

And use our object to make plots:

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="70%"}
ggplot(life_year, aes(x = year, y = avg_life)) + geom_line(size = 2, color = "#213772", alpha = .8) + labs(x = "Year", y = "Average life expectancy") + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans", base_size = 14)
```


---

# Using `group_by()`


We can even `group_by()` multiple variables 🤯: 

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>% #<<
  summarise(avg_life = mean(lifeExp))
```

---

# Using `group_by()`


Store as object:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
life_continent_year = gapminder %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>% #<<
  summarise(avg_life = mean(lifeExp))
```

---

# Make the plot


```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(life_continent_year, aes(x = year, y = avg_life, color = continent)) + 
  geom_line(size = 2, alpha = .8) + labs(x = "Year", y = "Average life expectancy") + theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans", base_size = 14) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") + scale_color_viridis_d(option = "rocket", end = .8)
```
