# Data, objects, variables

--

Objects are one of the most confusing parts of coding for new programmers

--

An **object** is a "thing" that lives in R that we can use; think of the pantry metaphor!

--

In this class, 99.99% of objects are just **data**

--

Data has **variables** which are represented as columns

--

Objects ➡️ Data ➡️ Variables

---

# Example: pokemon

Once you load the `pokemon` data in your homework, it becomes an object; you can tell it's an object because: 

--

1. it shows up in the top-right screen (the "environment")
2. when you type it out and run it in R you can see the contents

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon
```

---


# Objects have variables


Columns like `type1` are *variables*


```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon
```

---


# Altering objects

You can do stuff to objects, like subset based on rules (using `filter()`), creating new **variables** (with `mutate()`), etc. 

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  filter(type1 == "grass") %>% 
  mutate(height_mm = height_m * 1000)
```


---

# Nothing changed


But notice that the original pokemon data remains unchanged!

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon
```

---


# Why? 

--

The reason is because we did not *store* the changes we made as a new **object**

--

Stored: 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
grass_pokemon = pokemon %>% 
  filter(type1 == "grass") %>% 
  mutate(height_mm = height_m * 1000)
```

Not stored:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
pokemon %>% 
  filter(type1 == "grass") %>% 
  mutate(height_mm = height_m * 1000)
```


---


# Storing our changes as objects

Whenever we want to *alter* an object and *keep track* of those changes, we have to store them as a new object

```{r, echo = TRUE}
grass_pokemon
```

---


# Confused by the name

--

Objects are **different** from variables! Objects **contain** variables!

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
total_power = pokemon %>% 
  mutate(total_power = hp + attack + defense + speed)
```

Here, there is an **object** called "total_power" that contains a variable called "total_power"

--

So confusing! Don't do this! Choose a different name!

--

If a HW problem says "make a variable called Joe" don't store the changes as an object called "Joe"!

# Tortured metaphor: making a movie


.pull-left[

- Coding is like making a movie

- You can write a movie script ("code") that has all the steps to produce a scene ("data analysis"): 
    - stand here, say this, move there, wear that
    - filter this, mutate that
- But if you don't hit **record** ("store as an object") you won't capture any of it

# Summarizing data

--
Often, with data, we want to **compare** things

--

Are democracies more peaceful than autocracies? Does early-voting increase turnout? Are decapitated terrorist groups weaker?

--

To do this, we often rely on **statistical summaries** of our data: 

--

Means, medians, minimums, maximums, variances

---

class: center, middle
# Summary stats

--

The *mean*: 3, 4, 8 $\rightarrow$ $\frac{(3 + 4 + 8)}{3} = 5$

--

The *median*: 3, **4**, 8 $\rightarrow$ 4

--

The *minimum*: **3**, 4, 8 $\rightarrow$ 3

--

The *maximum*: 3, 4, **8** $\rightarrow$ 8


---


# Example: an experiment


Some counties let people vote **early**; others don't

--

Do counties with early provisions have **higher** turnout? 

---


# The data

.scroll-output[
```{r}
set.seed(1990)
fake = tibble(`Vote early?` = sample(x = c("Yes", "No"), size = 3000, 
                              replace = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(`Turnout (%)` = rnorm(n = 3000, mean = 40 + 10*I(`Vote early?` == "Yes"), sd = 5))

knitr::kable(head(fake, n = 100), align = "cc")
```
]


---


# Quantifying "higher"


We can compare the *averages* of counties that do have early voting against those that don't:

--

```{r}
fake %>% 
  group_by(`Vote early?`) %>% 
  summarise(`Average turnout` = mean(`Turnout (%)`)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

--

Counties with early voting have, **on average**, 10 percentage points higher turnout


---

# Mean vs. median


We almost always compare averages, but medians are helpful in some cases:

--

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
set.seed(1990)
fake = tibble(income = rexp(n = 500, rate = .005)) %>% 
  mutate(income = income * 350)

ggplot(fake, aes(x = income)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = red, alpha = .8) + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans") + 
  labs(title = "Fake distribution of household income in the US", 
       x = NULL, y = NULL) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(fake$income), 
             lty = 2, 
             size = 2, 
             color = yellow) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(fake$income), 
             lty = 2, 
             size = 2, 
             color = blue) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 300000, y = 75,
                label = glue::glue("median: {scales::dollar(round(median(fake$income), 0))}")), 
            color = blue, family = "Fira Sans Condensed", size = 5) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = 300000, y = 65,
                label = glue::glue("mean: {scales::dollar(round(mean(fake$income), 0))}")), 
            color = yellow, family = "Fira Sans Condensed", size = 5)
```

What's happening here?

class: middle, center
# One more stat: variation

--

Another way to compare data is by how much a variable *varies*

--

Some distributions are very *narrow*, others are very *wide*

--

Narrow = observations are similar; wide = observations are not similar

---

# Measuring variation: the standard deviation


If you're interested in the formula here it is: 

$$ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2}$$

--

But in human terms, the *bigger* the standard deviation the *wider* the distribution

---



# Measuring variation


Same average (~$50,000) different **standard deviations**. Can we use standard deviation to measure *equality*?


```{r}
fake = tibble(`narrow, sd = $5,000` = rnorm(n = 200, mean = 50, sd = 5), 
              `wide, sd = $10,000` = rnorm(n = 200, mean = 50, sd = 10), 
              `very wide, sd = $20,000` = rnorm(n = 200, mean = 50, sd = 20)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  mutate(value = value * 1000, 
         name = factor(name, levels = c("narrow, sd = $5,000", 
                                        "wide, sd = $10,000",
                                        "very wide, sd = $20,000")))

ggplot(fake, aes(x = value, fill = name)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white", alpha = .8) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(name)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + 
  theme_bw(base_family = "Fira Sans", base_size = 14) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "rocket", end = .8) +

# Summary statistics with `summarize()`


We can use `summarize()` to **calculate** things like the mean, median, etc.

# Using `summarize()`


Say I want to know the average life expectancy in the world in 2007:

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) #<<
```

---


# Using `summarize()`


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize() #<<
```

---

# Using `summarize()`


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(avg_life = mean(lifeExp)) #<<
```


Notice! how the data has been *summarized*: only one row!


---

# Using `summarize()`


What if I also wanted to know the **median** life expectancy?

--


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(avg_life = mean(lifeExp), 
            med_life = median(lifeExp)) #<<
```


Notice! how similar this looks to `mutate()`

---

# Using `summarize()`


What if I also wanted to know the **min** and **max** life expectancy?

--


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(avg_life = mean(lifeExp), 
            med_life = median(lifeExp), 
            min_life = min(lifeExp), 
            max_life = max(lifeExp))
```

---

# Using `summarize()`


What if I also wanted to know the **standard deviation** of life expectancy?

--


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(avg_life = mean(lifeExp), 
            med_life = median(lifeExp), 
            min_life = min(lifeExp), 
            max_life = max(lifeExp), 
            sd_life = sd(lifeExp))
```

---

# Using `summarize()`


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  summarize(avg_life = mean(lifeExp), #<<
            med_life = median(lifeExp), #<<
            min_life = min(lifeExp), #<<
            max_life = max(lifeExp), #<<
            sd_life = sd(lifeExp)) #<<
```

--

`summarize()` is like `mutate()` in that you are creating *new variables*

--

So note that you have to *name* the new variables!


---

## Sidenote: we can use summary functions in filter

--


.pull-left[
which country had the lowest life expectancy in 2007?

# Bane of my existence: missing data

--

In life, sometimes data is **missing**: respondent doesn't answer a question, no one knows how much wheat England produced in 1823, etc.

--

R represents missing data as **NA**

--

```{r}
pokemon %>% 
  filter(is.na(height_m)) %>% 
  select(name, type1, type2, height_m, weight_kg) %>% 
  sample_n(10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

---

# Bane of my existence: missing data


If you try to *summarize* data that has missing values, R will return `NA`:

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  summarise(average_height = mean(height_m))
```

---

# Bane of my existence: missing data

--

There are whole classes on what to do with missing data

--

In this class we will tell R to ignore missing observations, by adding `na.rm = TRUE` to our summary function

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  summarise(average_height = mean(height_m, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```

---

# Bane of my existence: missing data

--

If you're trying to calculate a summary statistic and keep getting `NA`...

--

99.99999% of the time you need to add `na.rm = TRUE` to your function!

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
pokemon %>% 
  summarise(average_height = mean(height_m, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```

# 🚨 Your turn: 🚢 trade 🚢 🚨

# 🚨 Your turn: 🚢 trade 🚢 🚨


Using the `trade` dataset:


.small[
1. How has InterGovernmental Organizations (IGOs) membership expanded over time? Calculate the *median* number of IGOs that countries belonged to in 1960. Repeat for 2010. About how much has IGO membership grown in 50 years? 

2. What is having a sea border worth? Look only at countries that have at least one sea border in the year 2010. What is the average value of exports among these countries? Do the same for countries with no sea borders. About how much more do countries with sea borders export than countries without?

3. Tricky: what was the country with the *most* exports in 1960? What about in 2012?

# Relationships

--
`summarize()` lets us calculate the min, max, median, mean, sd, etc., across the whole dataset

--

But what if we want to do this for different *groups* within the data? 

--

This is at the heart of making **comparisons**!

---


# Variation in trade over time: the brutal way

Say I wanted to know how much imports have **varied** for each country over time; how to do it?

--

I could use `filter()` to calculate the standard deviation of imports for each country, say, starting with China

```{r, echo = TRUE}
trade %>% 
  filter(country == "China") %>% #<< 
  summarise(var_trade = sd(imports, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```


---

# Variation in trade over time: the brutal way


I could go on to another country:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
trade %>% 
  filter(country == "Algeria") %>% #<< 
  summarise(var_trade = sd(imports, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```


---

# Variation in trade over time: the brutal way


And so on for all countries... but this is brutally tedious; there are so many countries in the world! (some say millions)


```{r, echo = TRUE}
trade %>% 
  filter(country == "Nepal") %>% #<< 
  summarise(var_trade = sd(imports, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```


---


# 😍: Using `group_by()`


We can use `group_by()` in combination with `summarize()` to calculate some stat **by** another variable in the data: 

--

```{r, echo = TRUE}
trade %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%  #<<
  summarise(var_trade = sd(imports, na.rm = TRUE)) #<<
```

---

# Using `group_by()`


Like with anything else, we can store our results as a new object: 


```{r, echo = TRUE}
var_time = trade %>% #<<
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(var_trade = sd(imports, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# Life expectancy over time

And use our object to make plots:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
top = var_time %>% 
  slice_max(var_trade, n = 10) %>% 
  mutate(type = "Top 10")
bottom = var_time %>% 
  slice_min(var_trade, n = 10) %>% 
  mutate(type = "Bottom 10")

bind_rows(top, bottom) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, var_trade), 
             y = var_trade, color = type)) + 
  ggalt::geom_lollipop(size = 1.2, alpha = .8) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(type), scales = "free_y") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = scales::label_wrap(10)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(red, blue)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Variation in trade over time\n(in millions of USD)")
```
