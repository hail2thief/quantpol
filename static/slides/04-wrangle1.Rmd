# The new starting point

--

Before, I  *wrangled* data and you plotted the finished product

--

Step 1 of all your code was `ggplot()`


--

Now, **you** will wrangle the data 

--

Step 1 is *the data object*

---


# Step two: the pipe


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# code from homework
movies `%>%`
  # exclude movies before 1980
  filter(year >= 1980) `%>%`
  # make decades variable
  mutate(decade = case_when(year >= 1980 & year < 1990 ~ "80s", 
                            year >= 1990 & year < 2000 ~ "90s", 
                            year >= 2000 & year < 2010 ~ "2000s", 
                            year >= 2010 ~ "2010s"))
```

# What are pipes? 


.pull-left[
- **Pipes** are a programming tool to string a series of functions on an object

- They look like this in R: ` %>% `

- OSX: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> 
- Windows: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> 
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/not-pipe.jpeg")
```
]

---

# Why pipes? 



With pipes: 😍

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% 
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000) %>% 
  select(body_mass_kg)
```





Without pipes: 🤢

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
select(mutate(filter(penguins, species == "Adelie"), body_mass_kg = body_mass_g / 1000), body_mass_kg)
```



---

# Making sense of pipes: "and then..."


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# code from homework
movies `%>%`
  # exclude movies before 1980
  filter(year >= 1980) `%>%`
  # make decades variable
  mutate(decade = case_when(year >= 1980 & year < 1990 ~ "80s", 
                            year >= 1990 & year < 2000 ~ "90s", 
                            year >= 2000 & year < 2010 ~ "2000s", 
                            year >= 2010 ~ "2010s"))
```

> Take the object movies, AND THEN filter such that year is greater than or equal to 1980, AND THEN...

# The formula


```{r,echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
THE DATA %>% 
  FIRST FUNCTION %>% 
  ANOTHER FUNCTION %>% 
  YET ANOTHER FUNCTION
```



---


class: center
# Our first wrangling function: `filter()`

--

`filter()` **subsets** data objects based on **rules**



```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/filter.png")
```


--

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
baby_subset <- babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Elizabeth")
```

Subset `babynames` to only babies named `Elizabeth`

---

# Using `filter()`


To use `filter()`, we need to tell R which **observations** we want to include (or exclude) using rules

--

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
baby_subset <- babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Elizabeth")
```


> take `babynames` and return all observations where the `name` variable *is equal to* "Elizabeth"


---

# Setting up rules: logical operators


.pull-left[
Filtering rules rely on **logical operators**

We filter data based on whether **variables** meet certain criteria

Equal to, not equal to, less than, more than, included in, etc.


]

.pull-right[
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ben.jpeg")
```
]

---

# The logical operators


```{r,echo = FALSE}
tribble(~Operator, ~meaning, 
        "==", "equal to", 
        "!=", "not equal to", 
        ">", "greater than", 
        "<", "less than", 
        ">=", "greater than or equal to", 
        "<=", "less than or equal to", 
        "%in%", "is among the set") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

???
Why double equal sign?

---

# Using `filter()`

```{r}
apples = tribble(~name, ~color, ~pounds, ~sweet,
        "Fuji", "red", 2, TRUE,
        "Gala", "green", 4, TRUE,
        "Macintosh", "green", 8, FALSE,
        "Granny Smith", "red", 3, FALSE)


apples %>% knitr::kable()
```

---

# Green and unsweet apples

```{r,echo = TRUE}
apples %>% 
  filter(color == "green") #<<
```



---

# Green and unsweet apples

```{r,echo = TRUE}
apples %>% 
  filter(color == "green") %>% 
  filter(sweet == FALSE) #<<
```


Same as:


```{r,echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
apples %>% 
  filter(color == "green", sweet == FALSE) #<<
```

---



# Apples that are at least 4 pounds

```{r,echo = TRUE}
apples %>% 
  filter(pounds >= 4)
```

---

## Apples that are either Fuji or Gala and weigh more than two pounds

```{r,echo = TRUE}
apples %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("Fuji", "Gala")) %>% 
  filter(pounds > 2)
```

> Notice how "lists" of things are wrapped in `c()`

---

## Combining rules

You can combine multiple rules using the AND (`&`) operator

"Observations where either *this* is true **AND** *that* is true"


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# apples that are red AND sweet
apples %>% 
  filter(color == "red" `&` sweet == TRUE)
```


Same as:


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# apples that are red AND sweet
apples %>% 
  filter(color == "red") %>% 
  filter(sweet == TRUE)
```


---

## The OR operator


The `|` allows you to combine **mutually exclusive** conditions

"Observations where either *this* is true **OR** *that* is true"

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# apples that are red and sweet OR green and sour
apples %>% 
  filter(color == "red" & sweet == TRUE | 
           color == "green" & sweet == FALSE)
```

# 🚨 Your turn: find the flights 🚨

.scroll-output[
```{r}
flights %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
]

---


# 🚨 Your turn: find the flights 🚨

--

Using the `flights_small` object, find the following:


--

1. Flights to Fort Lauderdale or Miami, in April

--

2. Flights in the winter that took off between 8:13am and 12:59pm

--

3. How many flights arrived late on Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Eve?



```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 10L)
```

---

# The last step: creating objects


Step 1-2: the data, the pipe, the wrangling functions


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
flights_small %>% 
  filter(dest == "FLL")
```

Step 3: store the subsetted data as a new **object** for later use

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
miami_flights = flights_small %>% 
  filter(dest == "MIA")
```

---

# Objects

In programming, **objects** can be used to store all sorts of stuff for later use: data, functions, values. We create objects using `=`

Like this: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
new_object = stuff %>% filter(year == 1999)
```


Or like this: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
new_object = 
  stuff %>% filter(year == 1999)
```

# Naming objects

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
-- Phil Karlton


Few rules: can't start with a number; use `_` to separate words

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Good
day_one
day_1

# Bad
DayOne
dayone
first_day_of_the_month
```

---

# The formula

--

1. *Wrangle* the data until you're satisfied with the output: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
apples %>% 
  filter(sweet == FALSE)
```


--


2. Store the output as a new object: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sour_apples = apples %>% 
  filter(sweet == FALSE)
```


--

3. Use the new object (e.g., plotting):

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(sour_apples, aes(x = name, y = pounds)) + geom_col()
```


---

# 🚨 Your turn: election analyst 🚨

Using the `elections` dataset:


1. Identify the worst place I've ever lived: Donald Trump won by more than 53% of the vote, median household income is less than $45,000, it's either in the South or the Northeast, and the population is between 155,000 and 156,000. What county is it?

2. Identify the counties that both Obama and Hillary won in 2012 and 2016 (respectively), but Trump won in 2020.

3. Make a (nice-looking!) barplot of 2020 results for a subset of your choosing and post on the Slack.
