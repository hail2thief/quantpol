# Weekly check-in

So far, you: 

--

somehow do not know how to make every graph from scratch based solely off memory

--

are confused about errors you are seeing for the first time in a computer program you've never used before

--

are unable to re-type all the code I am presenting on slides into your notes at what would be a rate on par with a professional court stenographer


---

exclude: true
# And yet...


```{r}

# Weekly check-in


You are *confused* and *unsure* of yourselves

--

But you are doing **well**

--

You've only been coding for two weeks

--

You just need to know how to piece together answers from notes + slides

--

You will **slowly** get better at coding, and dealing with errors (be patient!)

# Breaking it down: the puzzle

> Which counties in California did Romney beat Obama *by more than 20 percentage points*? Make a plot of your choosing about these counties.

Can be overwhelming at first but think about it in "chunks": 

--

1. Counties in California...

--

2. ...Romney beat Obama

--

3. ...By more than 20 points


---


# Breaking it down: the data


```{r, echo = TRUE}
elections
```

---

# Breaking it down: counties in California


```{r, echo = TRUE}
elections %>%
  filter(state == "CA") #<<
```

---

# Breaking it down: where Romney beat Obama

```{r, echo = TRUE}
elections %>%
  filter(state == "CA") %>%
  filter(per_gop_2012 > per_dem_2012) #<<
```

---

# Breaking it down: by more than 20 points...


Tricky!

```{r, echo = TRUE}
elections %>%
  filter(state == "CA") %>%
  filter(per_gop_2012 - per_dem_2012 > .2) #<<
```

---

# Breaking it down: store as an object

```{r, echo = TRUE}
romney_ca = elections %>% #<<
  filter(state == "CA") %>%
  filter(per_gop_2012 - per_dem_2012 > .2)
```


--

Storing objects is very important! The original `elections` dataset remains unchanged!


```{r, echo = TRUE}
elections
```



---


# Breaking it down: make the plot


Notice!! The data object I want is not `elections` anymore


```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="70%"}
ggplot(romney_ca, aes(x = name, y = per_gop_2012)) +
  geom_col(fill = "orange") + coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "2012 GOP vote share (%)", x = "County")
```

# The formula

--

- *Wrangle* the data until you're satisfied with the output:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
apples %>%
  filter(sweet == FALSE) %>% filter(pounds < 2)
```


--


- Store the output as a new object:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sour_apples = apples %>% #<<
  filter(sweet == FALSE) %>% filter(pounds < 2)
```


--

- Use the new object (e.g., plotting):

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(sour_apples, aes(x = name, y = pounds)) + geom_col()
```

# Making new variables with `mutate()`


`mutate()` **adds** new variables to data


```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mutate.png")
```

---

# Using mutate


Say I want a new variable that gives me the apple weight in **ounces**

This is called changing a variable's **scale**


```{r}
apples = tribble(~name, ~color, ~pounds, ~sweet,
        "Fuji", "red", 2, TRUE,
        "Gala", "green", 4, TRUE,
        "Macintosh", "green", 8, FALSE,
        "Granny Smith", "red", 3, FALSE)


apples %>% knitr::kable()
```

???
How to convert pounds to ounces
---

# Create an "ounces" variable

```{r,echo = TRUE}
apples %>%
  mutate() #<<
```


---

# Create an "ounces" variable

--

The new variable, ounces, is going to equal *pounds* multiplied by 16 (16 oz in a pound)


--


```{r,echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
apples %>%
  mutate(ounces = pounds * 16) #<<
```


---

# New variable -> new object

--

If I want to use this new variable later, I **have** to make a new object


--


```{r,echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
apples_oz = apples %>% #<<
  mutate(ounces = pounds * 16)
```


.pull-left[
```{r}
knitr::kable(apples_oz, caption = "apples_oz")

# normalizing variables


Say that in 2020 California had 300 murders and Wyoming had 100 murders. Is California **three times** as violent as Wyoming?


```{r}
ca = tibble(people = rnorm(n = 3000, mean = 200, sd = 20),
       state = "CA\n(300 deaths)") %>% 
  mutate(murders = ifelse(rbinom(n = n(), size = 1, prob = .1) == 1, "yes", "no"))

wy = tibble(people = rnorm(n = 200, mean = 200, sd = 20),
       state = "WY\n(100 deaths)") %>% 
  mutate(murders = ifelse(rbinom(n = n(), size = 1, prob = .5) == 1, "yes", "no"))

bind_rows(ca, wy) %>% 
  filter(murders == "yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state, y = people)) + 
  geom_quasirandom() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Deaths in CA and WY")
```


---

# Normalizing variables


Not *necessarily*! These states have very different underlying populations; if we consider this a different picture emerges


```{r}
bind_rows(ca, wy) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = state, y = people, color = murders)) + 
  geom_quasirandom() + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Deaths in CA and WY", 
       color = "Resident was:") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(red, blue), 
                     labels = c("Not murdered", "Murdered")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```


---

# Normalizing variables


To truly compare CA and WY we need to **take into account** the population of each

--

We want to know how many murders have taken place (or drug overdoses, or crimes, or COVID cases, or...) per person in the state (**per capita**)

--

This is called **normalizing** a variable; *changing* it so that we can make units more *comparable*

--

In math terms this is just dividing murders by population: 

$Murders_{per capita} = \frac{Murders}{Population}$ = "how many murders per person"

# 🚨 Your turn 🌡️ Climate change 🌡️ 🚨


Using `climate`, make the following two plots looking only at Germany, USA, China, India:


1. A grouped time-series of co2 emissions over time (separate country by color)


2. A grouped time-series of co2 emissions **per capita** over time (separate country by color)


Who's to "blame" for climate change? And where should we focus environmental efforts?

# Creating categories
---


# Creating categories with `case_when()`

--

Sometimes we want to create **categorical variables** (tall, short, poor, rich, Republican-leaning, Democrat-leaning, etc.)

--

We can use `case_when()`, a special function that goes **within** `mutate()`

--

Like `filter()`, `case_when()` also relies on logical operators

---

# Who won the county? And by how much?

```{r}
elections %>%
  select(name, state, per_gop_2020, per_dem_2020) %>%
  head() %>% knitr::kable(caption = "sample from elections dataset")
```

---


# Who won the county? And by how much?

Let's say we want to break down county results into four categories:

--

- places where R's won **big** (let's say big = more than 10 points)
- places where R's won *small* (from winning at all up to 10 points)
- places where R's lost *small* (from winning at all up to 10 points)
- places where R's lost **big** (let's say big = more than 10 points)

???
How to measure *size of win* based on vote shares?

---


# Winning categories

First we figure out *by how much* Republicans won (or lost) to Democrats in a county (this is called the **margin of victory**):

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
elections_margin = elections %>%
  mutate(reps_margin = per_gop_2020 - per_dem_2020) #<<
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
elections %>%
  select(state, name, per_gop_2020, per_dem_2020) %>%
  mutate(reps_margin = per_gop_2020 - per_dem_2020)
```


---


# Winning categories

We can use `case_when()` to build categories out of the margin variable


`case_when()` uses the following formula: `LOGICAL CONDITION ~ "category name"`

--

Like so:


```{r, echo = TRUE}
elec_win_cat = elections_margin %>%
  mutate(win_type = case_when(reps_margin >= .10 ~ "Big R win"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
elec_win_cat %>%
  select(name, state, reps_margin, win_type)
```

---


# Winning categories

The rest of the categories:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
elec_win_cat = elections_margin %>%
  mutate(win_type = case_when(reps_margin >= .10 ~ "Big R win", 
                              reps_margin > 0 & reps_margin < .1 ~ "Small R win", 
                              reps_margin < 0 & reps_margin > -.10 ~ "Small R loss", 
                              reps_margin <= -.10 ~ "Big R loss")) 
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
elec_win_cat %>%
  select(name, state, reps_margin, win_type)
```

---


# Make a plot

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(elec_win_cat, aes(x = per_gop_2020, fill = win_type)) +
  geom_histogram() + theme_light()
```

---


# 🚨 Your turn 🚨

Using the `elections` dataset:


1. Create a variable that tells you what happened in the 2016 election in each county. The variable should incorporate four possibilities: 

    1) the county was blue in 2012 and stayed blue in 2016;
    
    2) the county was red... and stayed red; 
    
    3) the county flipped from blue to red; 
    
    4) the county flipped from red to blue
    
2. Make a boxplot (or ridgeplot!) that compares household income (y-axis) across this variable (x-axis)
