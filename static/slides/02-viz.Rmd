What's going on in this graph? What variables are depicted, and how?

---

class: middle, center

# The **grammar** of graphics

--

**Data** = variables in a dataset

--


**Aesthetic** = visual property of a graph (position, shape, color, etc.)

--

**Geometry** = representation of an aesthetic (point, line, text, etc.)


---

# Mapping data to aesthetics



```{r}
df = tribble(~Data, ~Aesthetic, ~Geometry, 
             "GDP per capita", "Position(x-axis)", "Point", 
             "Life expectancy", "Position (y-axis)", "Point", 
             "Continent", "Color", "Point", 
             "Population", "Size", "Point")
knitr::kable(df)
```



1. Take the **data**, 

2. map it onto an **aesthetic**, 

3. and visualize it with a **geometry**

---

# In R


```{r}
df = tribble(~Data, ~`aes()`, ~`geom_`, 
             "gdpPercap", "`x`", "`geom_point()`", 
             "lifeExp", "`y`", "`geom_point()`", 
             "continent", "`color`", "`geom_point()`", 
             "pop", "`size`", "`geom_point()`")
knitr::kable(df)
```

---



## `ggplot()`: our first function ðŸ˜¢

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ggplot() #<<
```

---

## `ggplot`: specify the data

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(data = gap_07) #<<
```

---


## Use `aes()` to map data to aesthetics

```{r,echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) #<<
```

---


## add geometries and layers using `+`

```{r,echo=TRUE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point() #<<
```

---


## mapping population to size in `aes()`

```{r,echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, `size = pop`)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop)) + 
  geom_point()
```



---

## mapping continent to color in `aes()`

```{r,echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, `color = continent`)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---


## Other layers: add the missing titles with `labs()`

```{r,echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point() + `labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy", title = "Global wealth and health in 2007")`
```

```{r,echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point() + labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy", 
       title = "Global wealth and health in 2007")
```

Notice that text is placed within **quotation marks**!

---

## Other layers: add a theme

```{r,echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point() + labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy", title = "Global wealth and health in 2007") + 
  `theme_bw()`
```

```{r,echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point() + labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy", 
       title = "Global wealth and health in 2007") + 
  theme_bw()
```


There are many more themes, [here are a few](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html)

---


## The formula


```{r,echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
                          size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() + labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy", 
       title = "Global wealth and health in 2007") +
  theme_bw()
```


--

1. Tell `ggplot()` the data we want to plot

--

2. Map all variables onto aesthetics within `aes()`

--

3. Add layers like `geom_point()` and `theme_bw()` using `+`

---


## What's that country way out on the bottom right? 


```{r,echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gap_07, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
                          size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy", 
       title = "Global wealth and health in 2007") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  geom_label_repel(data = filter(gap_07, country == "Gabon"), 
                   aes(label = "???"), color = red, 
                   nudge_x = 5e3, size = 4, fontface = "bold")
```
