What we want out of our model:

Does TV news make people more energized to vote? Or does it turn them off from politics? 

**How much** does an additional hour of TV increase (or decrease) the likelihood that someone votes? 

**What level** of Y (voter turnout) should we expect for a given level of X (exposure to the news)?

# How does car weight impact fuel efficiency?

Remember, we want the underlying model from this line

$mpg = \beta_0 + \beta1 \times weight$


```{r, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point(color = blue, alpha = .8) + 
  theme_fancy + labs(x = "Weight (1000 lbs)", 
                     y = "Miles/gallon (mpg)") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = TRUE)
```

---


# Modeling in R

--

We can use the `lm()` function to create models in R, using this formula:

> lm(Y ~ X1, data = DATA)


--

```{r,echo = TRUE}
weight_model = lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars) #<<
```

Notice! Saved as a model object

---


# Extract the model

We can extract the model equation with `tidy()`, from the `broom` package

```{r,echo = TRUE}
tidy(weight_model)
```

---

# Making sense of the table


$mpg = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times weight$

```{r,echo = TRUE}
tidy(weight_model)
```

--

The `estimate` column gives us $\beta_0$ (intercept) and $\beta_1$ (slope for weight)

--

Note! We only care about the first two columns of `tidy()` so far

---


# Extract the model


$mpg = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times weight$


```{r}
tidy(weight_model) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

--

The intercept ( $\beta_0$ ) = 37.29

--

The slope ( $\beta_1$ ) = -5.3

--

The model: $mpg = 37.29 + -5.3 \times weight$

# Back to the cars

The model: $mpg = 37.29 + -5.3 \times weight$

How do we interpret the slope on *weight*? 

```{r, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point(color = blue, alpha = .8) + 
  theme_fancy + labs(x = "Weight (1000 lbs)", 
                     y = "Miles/gallon (mpg)") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = TRUE)

# Interpretation: continuous variables


.pull-left[
As you turn the dimmer (*treatment variable*) the light (*outcome variable*) changes

Turn the dimmer up, the light increases by SLOPE amount

Turn the dimmer down, the light decreases by SLOPE amount

The change is **gradual**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dimmer.jpeg")

---

# Interpretation: the slope

$mpg = 37.2 + \color{red}{-5.3} \times weight$



```{r}
tidy(weight_model) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```


--

**General**: for every *unit increase* in X (weight), Y (mpg) changes by $\color{red}{5.3}$ *units*

--

**Specific**: for every *ton of weight* you add to a car, you lose $\color{red}{5.3}$ *miles per gallon* of fuel efficiency


---


# Interpretation: the intercept


$mpg = \color{red}{37.2} + -5.3 \times weight$

--

Remember that the Y-intercept is the *value of Y when X = 0*


$$
\begin{aligned}
Y = 6 + 2x \\
X = 0 \\
Y = 6 + 2 \times 0 \\
Y = 6
\end{aligned}
$$
---


# Interpretation: the intercept


Take the formula: $mpg = \color{red}{37.2} + -5.3 \times weight$

--

Set X (weight) equal to 0 $\rightarrow$ $\color{red}{37.2} + (-5.3 \times 0) = \color{red}{37.2}$

--


**General**: The estimated value of Y (mpg), when X (weight) equals zero, is $\color{red}{37.2}$ units

--

**Specific**: The estimated fuel efficiency for a car that weighs *0 tons* is $\color{red}{37.2}$ miles per gallon

---


# Spot the intercept

$mpg = 37.29 + -5.3 \times weight$

```{r, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 7), ylim = c(0, 40)) +
  geom_point(color = blue, alpha = .8) +
  theme_fancy + labs(x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
                     y = "Miles/gallon (mpg)") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = TRUE) +
  geom_abline(data = NULL, intercept = coef(weight_model)[1],
              slope = coef(weight_model)[2], lty = 2, color = "black")
```

We can confirm we're not crazy if we zoom out

---


# Nonsense intercepts


$mpg = 37.2 + -5.3 \times weight$


Interpretation of the intercept:

> The average fuel efficiency for a car that weighs nothing is 37.2 miles per gallon

--

Note that this is **nonsense**: a car cannot weigh zero tons

--

You will run into this often: don't let it confuse you!

--

the intercept will rarely be useful on its own; But we **need** it to draw the line!


---


# Another example: gapminder


Say we want to estimate the relationship between **GDP per capita** and **life expectancy**


```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(color = red, alpha = .8) + theme_fancy
```

---


# The model

We fit the model using `lm()`

```{r,echo = TRUE}
wealth_mod = lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = gapminder)
```

--


We extract the coefficient estimates using `tidy()`

```{r, echo = TRUE}
tidy(wealth_mod)
```



---

# Interpreting the model

$LifeExp = \beta_0 + \beta1 \times gdpPercap$

```{r}
tidy(wealth_mod)
```

--

$\beta_1$, the slope = for every additional dollar of GDP, a country's life expectancy rises by .0007 years

--

$\beta_0$, the intercept = the average life expectancy for a country with no economic activity (GDP = 0) is 54 years

---


# The scale of the coefficients


$LifeExp = 54 + .0007 \times gdpPercap$


Slope: for every **dollar** increase in GDP, life expectancy increases by 0.0007 years

--

Tiny! Does this mean a country's wealth has little to do with their health?

--

No! It is a problem with the **scale** that GDP is in

--

one dollar differences in GDP are tiny, meaningless


---

# Variable scales


We can rescale GDP so that it's in 10s of thousands of dollars:

```{r,echo = TRUE}
gapminder = gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp_10k = gdpPercap/10000)
```

---


# Variable scales

Note the variable is the same; only thing that has changed is the scale!

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  select(`GDP (in dollars)` = gdpPercap, 
         `GDP (in tens of thousands of dollars)` = gdp_10k) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = red, alpha = .8, color = "white", bins = 30) +
  facet_wrap(vars(name), scales = "free") +
  theme_fancy + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)
```

---


# Re-fit the model



```{r,echo = TRUE}
wealth_mod_10k = lm(lifeExp ~ gdp_10k, data = gapminder)
tidy(wealth_mod_10k)
```

--

for every additional $10,000 of GDP, a country gains about 7 years

--

Mind your *scales*: if a coefficient is tiny, ask yourself if the scale makes sense

# ðŸš¨ Your turn: international trade ðŸš¨


`ir_econ` has data on international trade: 

.scroll-output[
```{r}
tribble(~variable, ~meaning, 
        "imports", "total imports, in current million USD",
        "exports", "total exports, in current million USD",
        "gdp", "GDP in 2011, USD", 
        "pop", "Estimated population", 
        "land_borders", "Number of land borders", 
        "mincapdist", "Distance to closest foreign capital, KM",
        "percent_mountain", "Percent of territory that is mountainous",
        "number_of_igos", "Number of international orgs country is part of") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
]

---

## ðŸš¨ Why do some countries export more than others? ðŸš¨

--

1. For a year of your choosing, make a scatterplot of imports (x-axis) and exports (y-axis) with a trend-line. Add labels so you can see which countries are the outliers. 

--

2. Estimate a model that tries to explain how much a country exports, using a treatment variable of your choosing. Interpret the model output.

# Categorical variables


We can also use categorical variables in our models

--

The simplest categorical variable is a *dummy variable*: 1/0, TRUE/FALSE

--

Men vs. women, young vs. old, has a policy in place (vs. not)

--

Let's say I wanted to look at the relationship between a country *being in the Americas* and life expectancy

--

This is a dummy variable: a country either is, or isn't, in the Americas

---


# Creating dummies

We can create that dummy using logical operators:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
gap_dummies = gapminder %>%
  mutate(is_americas = continent == "Americas")
```


Read: "IF the observation's continent equals "Americas", assign a TRUE, otherwise FALSE"

---


# Dummy variables

```{r}
set.seed(1990)
gap_dummies %>%
  sample_n(10) %>%
  select(country, year, is_americas) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---


# Dummy variables in models


I can include the dummy in a regression model:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
americas_mod = lm(lifeExp ~ is_americas, data = gap_dummies)
```

--

And look at the output:

```{r}
tidy(americas_mod)
```

---

# How to interpret categorical variables?


.pull-left[

Turn the light on (`is_america` goes from FALSE to TRUE), the light *increases* by SLOPE

Turn the light off (`is_america` goes from TRUE to FALSE), the light *decreases* by SLOPE

The change is **instant**

# What if I have more than one dummy?


Say I go back and create a dummy for each continent:


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gap_dummies = gapminder %>%
  mutate(is_africa = continent == "Africa",
         is_europe = continent == "Europe",
         is_asia = continent == "Asia",
         is_oceania = continent == "Oceania",
         is_americas = continent == "Americas")
```


---

# Multiple dummies


I can include more than one dummy in a regression:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
dummy_mod2 = lm(lifeExp ~ is_americas + is_europe, data = gap_dummies)

tidy(dummy_mod2)
```

---


# Multiple dummies

.small[
$\operatorname{\widehat{lifeExp}} = 53.7 + 10.96(\operatorname{is\_americas}) + 18.2(\operatorname{is\_europe})$

.small[
`is_americas` = countries in the Americas have, on average, 11 years more of life expectancy than countries not **in the Americas or Europe** (so: Asia, Africa, Oceania)

`is_europe` = countries in Europe have, on average, 18 years more of life expectancy than countries not **in the Americas or Europe** (so: Asia, Africa, Oceania)

`intercept` = set `is_americas` and `is_europe` equal to 0. Countries in Africa, Oceania, and Asia (not in Americas or Europe) have an average life expectancy of 53.7 years

]


---

# The pattern

Notice how the coefficient in each dummy is how much *higher* or *lower* the continent is, relative to the intercept (every other continent)

--

As you add more continent dummies, the coefficient changes

--

It becomes: how much higher or lower that continent is relative to the intercept, which now **excludes** the other continent dummies in the model

--

This means that as the number of dummies increases, the number of continents in the intercept **decreases**


---


# More complicated categorical variables


Most of the variables we care about are not just dummies

--

They take on many values

--

E.g., education levels, sex, race, religion, etc.

--

What happens when we include one of these in a model? 

---


# Categorical variables = dummies

If you fit a model with a categorical variable, R will automatically break it up into n-1 dummies

```{r, echo = TRUE}
continent_model = lm(lifeExp ~ continent, data = gapminder)

tidy(continent_model)
```


---

# The same!

.pull-left[
```{r,echo = TRUE}
bigcat = lm(lifeExp ~ continent, 
   data = gapminder)
tidy(bigcat)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
dummy_cat = lm(lifeExp ~ is_americas + is_europe + 
     is_asia + is_oceania,
   data = gap_dummies)
tidy(dummy_cat)
```

# Interpretation formula


```{r}
tribble(~Type, ~Approach, ~Intercept,
        "Continuous", "A one unit increase in X, SLOPE unit change in Y", "Average value of Y when X = 0",
        "Category", "The category is SLOPE units higher/lower than the intercept", "Average value of Y for baseline (missing) category") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


Interpreting coefficients is pretty confusing; it just requires practice


---


# We're on our way


We now know (sorta) how to interpret the coefficients on those big tables in the political science papers:

--

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/reg-table.png")
```


---



# ðŸš¨ Your turn: number of kids ðŸš¨

--

1. Do happier people tend to have more or fewer kids than less happy people? Using the `gss_sm` dataset, regress `childs` (outcome) against `happy` (treatment). Interpret the output.

--

2. Which religions have the biggest families? Regress the number of siblings `sibs` (outcome) against respondent religion `relig`. Based on the output: which religion has the largest families, on average?

--

.small[
Hint: to figure out what values a categorical variable takes on, use the `distinct()` function, like so: `data %>% distinct(variable)`
