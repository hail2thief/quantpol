- Countries like the US spend lots of resources trying to kill, capture leaders of *non-state armed groups*
    - Rebel groups, terrorist orgs, organized crime
    
    
- This is known in the literature as **decapitation**

## Not so fast

Groups that **are** decapitated are *different* from groups that **aren't** decapitated

`???` = Strength, resources, size, location, etc.

Ignoring these differences will **confound** our estimates!

# What is this class about?

**Wrangling** data to answer the questions we care about

Using **models** to explore relationships in the political world

Thinking **causally** about the relationships we observe


---

class: center, middle
# An emphasis on **doing**


*No readings* or giant, cram-in-one-day exams

--

regular, *sustained* practice with hands-on problem sets

--

*synthesize* what you learn in a final project

class: center, middle
# Programming as a way in


&lt;img src="images/rstudio.png" width="60%" /&gt;


10 weeks of focused study in **R**, a powerful and in-demand programming language


---


# Class philosophy:


Little to none of this: 

`$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2} {n}$$`

--

More of this: 


```r
m1 = glm(failure ~ decap, data = df)
pDat = ggeffects::ggeffect(m1, terms = "decap") %&gt;%  as_tibble()
ggplot(pDat, aes(x = factor(x), y = predicted, 
                 ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high, 
                 color = factor(x))) + 
  geom_pointrange(size = 2, fatten = 2, 
                  alpha = .8)
```

# This class is practical


This class *could* be a couple lines on a resume:


.pull-left[
- Able to work with data = marketable skill

- R is popular in industry

- Familiarity with R `\(\rightarrow\)` other languages

- Principles learned in R can be applied elsewhere (Excel)

- Problem-solving in Slack

# There's a lot of work, and coding, in this class

.pull-left[

- I warned you!

- Anyone can do it, yes "*even*" you

- you will be surprised at what you can do by the end

- But you have to try your best

- If this doesn't work for you, take another class

class: center, middle, inverse
&gt; It‚Äôs easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm really stupid,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not made out to program.‚Äù But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It‚Äôs just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don‚Äôt blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

Chief Data Scientist at RStudio

# For the love of all that is good

--

**Do** the weekly check-ins; they are free points

--

**Go** to section, ask for help on Slack

--

**Do not** miss homeworks in this class

--

Missing one = leaving a big chunk of your final exam blank

--

I want students who are working hard to do well

--

Half done home work is **strictly better** than no homework
