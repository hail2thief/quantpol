- Countries like the US spend lots of resources trying to kill, capture leaders of *non-state armed groups*
    - Rebel groups, terrorist orgs, organized crime
    
    
- This is known in the literature as **decapitation**

## Not so fast

--

Groups that **are** decapitated are *different* from groups that **aren't** decapitated

`???` = Strength, resources, size, location, etc.

--

Ignoring these differences will **confound** our estimate of the effect of decapitation!

# What is this class about?

--

**Wrangling** and **visualizing** data to explore the questions we care about

--

Using **models** to describe how one political variable might cause another 

--

Thinking **causally** about the relationships we observe

--

Grappling with **uncertainty** in the relationships we observe


---

class: center, middle
# An emphasis on **doing**

--

*No readings* or giant, cram-in-one-day exams

--

regular, *sustained* practice with hands-on problem sets

--

*synthesize* what you learn in a final project

# Programming as a way in


&lt;img src="images/rstudio.png" width="60%" /&gt;


10 weeks of focused study in **R**, a powerful and in-demand programming language


---


# Class philosophy:


Little to none of this: 

`$$\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2} {n}$$`

--

Lots of this: 


```r
m1 = glm(failure ~ decap, data = df)
pDat = ggeffects::ggeffect(m1, terms = "decap") %&gt;%  
  as_tibble()
ggplot(pDat, aes(x = factor(x), y = predicted, 
                 ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high, 
                 color = factor(x))) + 
  geom_pointrange(size = 2, fatten = 2, 
                  alpha = .8)
```

# This class is practical


This class *could* be a couple lines on a resume:


.pull-left[
- Ability to work with data ‚û°Ô∏è marketable

- R is popular in industry

- Familiarity with R ‚û°Ô∏è other languages

- Principles learned in R can be applied elsewhere (Excel)

- Problem-solving in Slack

.pull-left[

- I warned you!

- Anyone can do it, yes "*even*" you

- you will be surprised at what you can do by the end

- But you have to try your best

- If this doesn't work for you, take another class

class: center, middle, inverse
&gt; It‚Äôs easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm really stupid,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not made out to program.‚Äù But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It‚Äôs just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don‚Äôt blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

|This is my first coding class and I was told this class could be quite difficult so my only concern would be keeping up with the concepts and making sure I understand them                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|I am concerned that the class would be too convoluted in learning as coding deals with math.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|I believe that the shooter should not allowed to be euthanized because his life in prison would not be an "arduous" one. All of his meals, healthcare, and housing will be taken care of for the rest of his life. In addition, allowing the shooter to kill himself before the trial would save him from the words and emotions of the loved ones of those who he had taken from them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|I think the victims are right. The shooter chose to put himself in a situation where he could be injured and was causing harm. Euthanasia should be for those who largely don't have control of the reason they're performing it (ex illness).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|I do believe that the shooter should have some say in their own life given the statute of basic human rights we are all allotted. However, in this situation because of the crimes committed I could see how families might want a say in how the punishment is given. Nevertheless, due to these circumstances I feel as though the shooter‚Äôs fate should be decided by an unbiased jury based on the facts of the case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|I think that the victim's families have a point because if you lost someone you really love you would want whoever did it to have the worse punishment and suffering ever in compensation of they did to someone you love. I think they should not allow the mass shooter to have the choice to kill himself and rather go with the original plan of going to prison and have him suffer with the consequences of his actions that he deserves and fulfill the victim's families needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|Personally, I believe they should allow the shooter to pursue euthanasia. Keeping him in prison will not reverse the damage he has inflicted both emotionally and physically on the victims and their families. I think it would be a mistake to pronlong or inflict the needless suffering of one person when it provides no material value to those who have been affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|The victims' families are in the right here. Since the shooter committed a crime and is sent to prison- their natural or civil rights are limited by their circumstance. The mass shooter's autonomy would be overruled due to their crime. And with any crime, trial and potentially prison would need to be prioritized (especially because of the due process of law).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|Obviously the family's wish to keep the shooter alive and put into prison is valid. In America, we tend to assume the prison life will fix a "prisoner", but it seems as though other countries are fast to realize sometimes the root of the problem becomes more aggravated in prison. I would assume the lawyer is right in this case. If the shooter is suffering from this shooting and wishes to die, if the law permits it he has the right to that consequence. At this point, since the shooter is an adult he is capable of making decisions for his own life. The lawyers are going by the law and are providing three points as to why euthanasia is viable in this case, whereas the shooters family does not seem to expand. While I think euthanasia could be viewed as a way out of a life in prison, making the decision to end one's own life is not an easy one. Just looking at the law Spain passed it seems that the court would rule in the favor of the shooter. The law does not seem to have any exceptions as stated above such as "unless the person is involved in a crime", thus it seems the desire to carry on with euthanasia would be granted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|I think the shooter should not be allowed to commit legal suicide since he broke a law first that should take away further privileges that he wants to diverge in. He wants sympathy and mercy for his wounds, but what about those he already killed? How is it fair that a mass shooter receive justice even though his victims won't? I think if you break the law, the privilege to choose your own life choices are instantaneously taken away. Our justice departments and systems should follow this mantra.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|It is very recognizable and understandable that the victims families want the shooter to be punished to pay for the lives he took, I would be one to feel this way too, but there is a line between punishment and suffering. This is a difficult case to show light to who is right and who is wrong. If the shooter is severely wounded he may still die shortly after his sentence to life in prison. I feel like the shooter will die regardless if its through euthanasia or simply because of the severity of his state so the shooter's proposal of dying at the hands of euthanasia should be granted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|I think that the shooter's lawyers are in the right. I understand the victims' families' argument of not allowing this person to evade punishment, but life in prison while suffering from the long-term consequences of severe injury seems almost inhumane. Perhaps a way his can be resolved if for the shooter to undergo the trial process, and be euthanized after.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|I don't think that there is necessarily a party who is "right" here, since this covers such a moral gray area. I think that more details are needed, like how old the shooter is and what type of injury he sustained. A case like this is very nuanced and situational, so I think it would come down to the details. However, based on the facts given, I think that the shooter should be able to commit euthanasia, as he meets the requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|I think that its up to the person‚Äôs whose life it is. I know that if they choose euthanasia, people might feel like they took the ‚Äúeasy way out‚Äù by not suffering the consequences of their crimes, but at the end of the day we do not truly know what happens after death. If the life we live right now is truly the only life we have on this earth, isn‚Äôt it bad enough that the shooter spent it neglecting the lives of others and themself. If they choose to make a recovery and spend their sentence, whose to say they will come out as a more peaceful person. Either way, in both cases of life or death they will have a made a bad name for themselves far into the future. I think the ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù people believe the shooter deserves comes both ways and it is ultimately up to the shooter how they want to experience that suffering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|It depends on what "too ardous" ,means, since the law can be vague so anyone can use the law whenever they believe so. But I believe his life being "too ardous" due to his mental state does not apply to this situation due to his knowing of the crime and not willing to pay the crime for his actions. This law should not be applied to him due to his knowing about the crime unless he is diagnosed with a mental health.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|Fighting the urge to dive into the philosophy of Plato from POL 004, morally the shooter should be allowed to commit euthanasia, as it enacts the death penalty and in some way punishes the shooter while also giving him a relatively more painless option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|The shooter should undergo trial first since his condition did not originate from "health issues," but through the criminal act of murder. However, since prisoners do not lose their constitutional and human rights in prison, the shooter should be able to undergo euthanasia after he is sentenced and jailed. This is effectively a compromise between the two positions. On the one hand, the families receive a degree of consolation through the shooter's sentencing, but the shooter is still able to exercise his legal right to die post-conviction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|I think for a law like that to exist there needs to be guidelines and rules. If we were to follow the law with no context or rules the shooter would be able to commit suicide but, if there were technicalities like all laws should have so they're not misused, in my option they would not be allowed to. There are rules that prevent a person from voting or being able to obtain a gun after committing crimes so there should be similar rules in this case. So, in my opinion the law should have rules to prevent situations like these or situations where if the person is committing suicide to prevent dealing with the repercussions of their actions they shouldn't be allowed to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|In this case, I would probably prefer that the shooter lives out his time in prison and doesn't go through with euthanasia. However, if the shooter truly gets to the point where life is too arduous out of his control to decide that, then he should be given the right of legal suicide. Overall, I don't think there is anyone who is exactly right, but I would side with the victims families over the criminal if I truly had to choose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|Values on which I was raised tempt me to focus on the 'right' thing to do, rather than considering just who are the ones vying for the power to determine its rightness. In the states, we often look at this dilemma on its flipside: whether to grant a defendant's plea for life when their accusers call for a judgment of death. Why, though, should anyone want to live in a world where a government has greater say in their own life or death than they do themselves? This scenario screams the issue that is weighing state interest against personal interest. Considering that a recovery avenue exists for those in similar circumstances, save for the stigma of a criminal label, an objective person should embrace the new law's equal application. Clarence Darrow has very recently taught me some of the disutility that comes from our zeal to punish wrongdoers despite the lack of recourse for crimes committed and damage irrevocably wrought. Through judgment based in laws written by the powerful, his livelihood has already been stripped away. The failed experiment of punishment obsesses with twisting a knife of torture and fear, as if rehabilitation and repentance are actually antithetical to its warped vision of 'justice'. Besides, should a person with a right to trial not have the right to forfeit their role in it if they have already accepted culpability? Could a 'just' record not be laid out in posthumous court proceedings? The defendant's decisions and medically based eligibility should warrant the legal avenue of euthanasia. No government should spar against an individual over rightness when the latter's life is on the line, whichever side of it that government may be on. |
|The shooter should go to jail as part of the justice for the lives that he killed. We are much past the ‚Äútrading lives‚Äù and justice is not death.

|I don‚Äôt think the shooter should be allowed to commit euthanasia. While their life might be too arduous due to the health issues stemming from the shootout, justice must still be served. A person like that must answer to their crimes. They broke the law when they committed those crimes, so why should they expect the law to favor him. I think they should proceed with the trial and reassess his condition if it is truly that arduous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|I think he should have to serve his sentence rather than being euthanized, the victims' families are right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|I think he is living out a punishment worse than prison, which is being forced to live with his condition. I think he should be allowed to go through with euthanasia bc any other action taken would be torturous for him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|In this scenario, I am going to agree with the victims' families. I think that the trial and likely imprisonment should occur, because it seems like the shooter wants to take the easy way out and avoid the consequences of his actions with the euthanasia. I am typically a supporter of medical euthanasia for people who are severely suffering, but for the shooter, he committed a horrible crime killing others and I don't believe should get to walk away unpunished. If the trial sentences him to life in prison, then I think that is what he deserves for what he has done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|I do agree with the families that the shooter should stay in prison for life. The shooter should go into maximum security prison that forces him to stay inside his prison cell 24 hours a day. The torture of being in pain from his health issues and being confined in a cell with nothing to do is less than what the families of the shooter's victims have to suffer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|I think they are both right. The shooter is a person and has a right to life and death despite his crimes. The victims have a right to seek justice, find disclosure and peace. However, is taking the rights of one person away just to send them to suffer, no matter if it's believed to be deserved, really a way to find any of that? I don't know if it is or what I would do in the position of the victims' family, but the way of the modern justice system works doesn't seem to provide what people need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|I think the victim's families are looking at this situation with a desire for revenge as they want to punish the shooter. While life in prison is a punishment, I think the more important issue is preventing the shooter from being a threat to society in which case euthanasia will prevent that. I understand the desire for revenge/punishment but I think euthanasia should be granted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|The victims' families are in the right, and the shooter should be incarcerated. However, it is to note that he should be housed separately from minor crime offenders and given harsher treatment. Health issues are no excuse for the crimes which he committed upon others, instead of considering euthanasia or other measures beforehand, he chose to take the lives of others and thus should be subjected to a life of punishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|I think think that becase he qualifies for euthanasia it doesn‚Äôt mean that it should be granted to him because he did commit murder. I would like to say that the damage done to his health is punishment enough but I think that could have been consequences to his actions and his actions have to be brought to justice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|The victims' families are right in this scenario, because the mass shooter already committed the crimes, and now that this law has been passed, to me personally it seems like a free ticket of out jail situation.

|Death is the ultimate punishment. In trial and prison, if the judge decides the health issues are arduous enough, the new Spanish law would allow euthanasia. Because this is allowed by law, and the shooter would face the ultimate punishment of death, having the shooter face the punishment of of life in prison would not be more of a punishment than losing his life. Therefore, the shooter's lawyers are right, and I think the shooter should face the punishment his lawyers have decided, as it's what the law allows and would serve the justice desired by the victims' families.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|In my humble opinion, it seems like the shooters lawyers are making an argument I would consider during an appeal, not the main trial. His trial is to determine sentence for the crimes committed, his situation because of his actions during the crime would be irrelevant to me as a judge, I would need to first determine his sentence and if it is life in prison, so be it. The lawyers can appeal for legal suicide but I would not consider it during the main trial. However I do not know the precedent in Spain for this situation, they may even consider doing hospice in prison or letting the shooter serve 25 years or a set number and then qualify to appeal for legal suicide after the set amount of years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|If he meets the requirements of euthanasia, he should be allowed to do so. A way to determine this would be to look at rulings with people in similar medical conditions as him. Even if I do sympathize with the victim's family, this person should be treated the same as other patients with similar medical status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|I think having several doctors examine his physical and mental state are a good first step and then determining if he is fit for trial. As much as it hurts that a mass shooter cannot undergo a trial if they are severely impacted where they might die from injury anyways, one must look at this person from a medical standpoint not just from their poor choices. Both sides are right, which makes the situation tough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|I think I would need more information on the shooter's condition. From the description, it doesn't seem that his life is "too arduous," but it's possible that he was injured more severely.

|I think the victim‚Äôs family is right here because by U.S standards, breaking the law the shooter has forfeited some of his civil liberties.

|I think people should know there are consequences for their actions. Since he did create a very big crime, he should be punished in jail. But, he did get hurt and should be treated. So in summary, he should not be able to evade his punishment because then it's kind of like "giving a reward" to the mass shooter after he killed many people, he has to pay for his actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|I think this is a challenging situation. While I would typically side with the victims of a mass shooting, this prompt has made me think a lot. I understand where some of the lawyer's points are coming from. I can assume that the shooter could die during the trial or soon into his time in prison. In that case the victim's families might still be upset that his punishment wasn't properly served. I think there should be justice for the victims' family in another way and I would side with the lawyers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|I think the law should have contingencies about who would be eligible to commit euthanasia. For example, the law should not apply to people who are awaiting trial. If these contingencies don't exist, then I think his condition would merit euthanasia according to the law. However, I think this is unfair and that the shooter should serve life in prison instead of having a way to evade his punishment. Overall, the law that allows people to commit euthanasia if life is "too arduous" should be amended to be more specific, so that criminals can't use it as a scapegoat to avoid their punishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|This situation is difficult morally, because his sentence will most likely result in death anyways, and if he were sentenced to death, isn't that somewhat similar to being euthanized? Also, given his physical condition, he most likely would not live long anyways. If he wants to die and was willing to commit a mass shooting, sitting in a cell seems like it will not actually make him remorseful for his actions. What should happen, then, is he should be allowed to use euthanasia, and the country should dedicate the time and money they would have used keeping him in prison to either memorialize the victims, or create better education and prevention of mass shootings to avoid the situation in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|I think the victims' families are in the right to be upset.

|I don't know who is right here, or whether we are defining right as in "right morally" or "right legally," but it doesn't sound like there is a legal right yet established. As for who is morally right, I can understand both sides of the argument, but a lot of details evade me. Why did he commit a mass shooting? My first instinct is that it was a hate crime, but I could be wrong here. How was he injured? What is his current quality of life? How many people did he kill? How long has he been waiting for trial? If he hasn't been waiting long, then the argument there could be that he hasn't lived long enough disabled to describe his life as "too arduous." Either way, all the potential arguments I can see are favoring the families and not the shooters. For instance, I don't know anything about Spanish law, but if he's awaiting trial than the state is responsible for his life and his quality of life. I don't know how I feel about that. From what I know, I would say that he should not be euthanised and instead have to proceed through the trial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|This is difficult for me because in cases like this, I'd want to honor both requests. But I would have to side with the families because it is stated that the shooters wish is to die which is the same as the families. I would stand by my decision, even though I don't think the shooter deserves to die because we are humans in the end and deserve a happy life. Situations like these are tricky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|Morally, I think that the victims' families are right to demand the shooter be tried and punished for his crimes. The lawyers do present a good case, however, I do not think that it is warranted in this situation. Shooters should not be allowed to get away with such crimes against people as a result of a law intended to alleviate the suffering of its people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|I believe that justice in this case still must be carried out. At the very least, the shooter must stand trial and judgement. However, I also believe that incarcerated individuals should be afforded the same basic rights as most of us, so if the shooter, after being convicted, would still like to be euthanized, and it is determined that his living state is indeed ‚Äúarduous‚Äù then he should be euthanized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|There are really no right or wrong answers for this type of situation. There are very strong opinionated people with intense emotions and connotations to one side or another. Personally, I think that if the shooter wants to commit euthanasia and if it is well within his right, then he should be allowed to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|Despite the shooter being someone who should serve time based on the law, he is still merely awaiting his trial. He has not been convicted or sentenced yet, so this legal suicide has to be allowed. Although he is awaiting his sentence, he hasn't received it. He cannot be evading it if he hasn't yet received it. Although this would be very upsetting to the families of the victims, this man is still not yet guilty by law, so the law likely does allow for him to do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|I don't think the suffrage of someone else makes the grief of victims family's any easier. Along with that, there have been many enacted laws within the United States that prevent the family's of victims of intervening in legal cases due to their obvious bias, which I think is an important law. Taking both of these opinions into account, I would say that you must follow the law that allows euthanasia while not allowing bias and persuasion of the victims family's to change any verdict of the case- just as the courts within the U.S. are suppose to do. I also think that one wrong doesn‚Äôt justify another wrong; this speaks directly to the prison system that has been practiced around the world‚Ä¶ even for such harsh crimes being committed, like this example here, I don‚Äôt think its moral to have someone spend their life behind bars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|I think the lawyers are correct. Intentionally keeping the shooter alive while suffering is cruel and vindictive. I think the shooter should be euthanized because they don't deserve to live and breath after taking so many lives. Although it may provide comfort to the grieving families to know that the shooter is being punished by living the rest of their life in a jail cell, I believe it's inhuman to keep someone alive if they have serious health issues that prevent them from living on their own. If the shooter was unharmed and able-bodied, I would say let him live the rest of his days in a cell but since he struggles to live it feels wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|This is a tough question to answer. In my head I know that the law applies to criminals and murderers too, but the knowledge of the crime kind of skews my thoughts. If the shooter had just been killed during the shootout, would the families have been satisfied? What if he didn't want to die but he passed away later from his injuries? Ultimately I think that he should be allowed to die because the law applies to murderers too and despite the rightful outrage of the families, ultimately they are not judge, jury nor executioner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|Before giving my exact opinion I would want a third party medical doctor to review his condition and possibility to recover. But considering he is actually has an irreparable injury he can choose to end his life.

|I don‚Äôt think he should be allowed to evade life in prison. I support assisted suicide, and either way he is wasting tax payers money by a) opting for assisted suicide b) going through trial and serving a life sentence c) being executed.

I think the families are right in this situation and he should not be allowed to opt for the easy way out, especially if the law was created for terminally ill citizens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|A professional should check the shooter if his condition is deemed posable for reasons unrelated to his posable punishment then let him have euthanasia. otherwise he should be denied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|I think either side has a different argument for each point, so I don't think there is a set right or wrong. I think that the shooter is a human whose actions have consequences which the victim's family deserves to see him receive. I also don't know if the shooter feels guilty for what he did especially now that he is rendered severely injured. I think that he should not be allowed to evade his punishment but at the same time the state of his body is pretty similar to life in prison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|While I understand that the victims and their families want justice for their family members, I also believe that just because someone has committed crimes (even atrocious ones) should not have their rights stripped away. I think that if his condition is to the point that is covered by the legal suicide law than he should be allowed to practice his rights. However, the wanting to die might be a result from guilt and fear of facing consequences. It's tricky, but I think overall, if his condition is as bad as they say than yes, but if the doctor evaluates it and says that it is not, than no.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|In my opinion, I believe that the families have a right to be upset at the potential of the shooter bypassing any retributive justice because it essentially acts as a symbol of not only the loss of their loved ones but as a dismissal of their sentiments.Therefore, I think that the perpetrator should attend the trial and accept imprisonment if he is apologetic at all towards the families and takes responsibility for what he has done. There are clearly several layers to this case, but though he is legally permitted to euthanize himself, he should be rightfully convicted and obliged to spend his life in prison to repent for the lives he has taken and the lives he changed forever in the process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|I dont think there is only one right person. I believe in euthanasia because I think having to suffer greatly for months awaiting your death is inhumane. However, this is more complicated. If euthanasia is legal it is a right the shooter has.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|I would say the shooter is in the wrong on this one, because he took the lives of others and did not give them a chance to live.

|I think that in this case, the crime was committed before the irreparable damage occurred. The injuries to the shooter only happened due to his crime and he would have otherwise been healthy. I think that he should not be able to commit euthanasia as his injuries were a direct result of his crime and he should stand trial so that the victims and their families can be at peace. Once the trial has occurred and a verdict has been decided, then it should be up to the shooter whether he wants to commit euthanasia or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|I think the mass shooter should have to wait for his trial and go through with his punishment of life in prison.

|I think it should be up to a jury after his health and condition are examined and spoken upon by an expert witness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|I would be in favor of euthanasia, but perhaps not until the trial occurred. If the shooter's life is considerably worse because of the injury, then they would be entitled to commit euthanasia under the new law. Additionally, the shooter spending the rest of his life in jail is not serving anyone, except perhaps the families' desire for justice. In my opinion, this desire for justice is not a good enough reason to keep someone alive if they have already been convicted of their crime. Having the individual spend the rest of their life in prison is merely creating more suffering instead of creating greater justness and restitution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

|The shooter is likely right here, because even murderers deserve basic rights, and if other people are allowed to commit euthanasia, he should be able to as well. He isn't really evading his punishment either, since while he won't be going to prison, he certainly is not going to be able to harm anyone else, which is the main point of prison, not revenge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|Depending on the extent of the shooters injuries I think that he should have to go through trial and then after the trial his decision to euthanize himself should be revisited, if he is in a state that he is not able to participate in his trial though then I would look at it differently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|The shooter should definitely stand trial. The message legislators are sending to citizens is if society upsets them, then it‚Äôs okay to hurt others only if you hurt yourself too.

|The concept of righteousness/morality/ethics is very dependent on perspective and has such an intersectional aspect, as this is different for every culture. I'm not that familiar with the Spanish ideologies, but personally, I think that they should be prosecuted for their crimes first. What he did is cruel and brutal and he and others must know of it. Moreover, justice must be served by those who were victims of his crimes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|I think that it is completely valid that the families want justice for their family members, and that euthanasia would be an "easy way out". The goal of the criminal justice system is to reform those who have committed less serious crimes, and detain those who are a danger to society. The mass shooter has taken lives, which is not redeemable or reformable. though he should face life in prison, the right thing to do is allow for the euthanasia, as long as his condition merits it. punishment in the criminal justice system should never be inhumane, and allowing someone to suffer due to medical issues when they would rather die is inhumane. though the families want justice, true justice would be gun reform or mental health resources to prevent mass shootings in the first place. nothing can bring those victims back, but an eye for an eye would only allow for the criminal justice system to violate the human rights of other criminals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|I believe the shooter should not have the option of euthanasia given that he committed a crime and he should be punished accordingly by making his time in prison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|I don't think any one person is "right" in this specific legal situation. The shooter should go through the trial but not be barred from euthanasia when in prison should his injuries persist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|I don't know, as there is a lot of missing information. I would need to know what the standard of "too arduous" is, and what the shooter's condition is.

|The shooter should undergo trial, sentencing, and his prison sentence. When he decided to kill innocent people, he obviously had no care for their lives or the damage his actions would do. For that reason he should have to serve his sentence as letting him commit legal suicide essentially negates any repercussion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|Euthanasia in the criminal justice system could be easily abused; those in power have the potential to coerce prisoners into committing euthanasia, an act that would then be comparable to the death penalty. I think if the shooter, despite his physical injuries, is deemed mentally sound (whatever that means), he should be allowed to commit assisted suicide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|Dying may technically be evading punishment, but that should not be a problem. Prisons should not be used to make people suffer. If he wants to die because his condition is too painful to live in, he should be allowed to die. This punishment mindset that the victims' families have might be justified, but that shouldn't be enforced by the court. If the purpose of prison is to either rehabilitate or keep criminals out of societies, then this person is (a) not going to rehabilitate because their condition is too poor, and (b) not going to be in any society if they choose to die, so euthanasia should not be an issue in this case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I agree with the victims' families in this matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|I think the victims‚Äô families are right. The mass shooter is likely trying to evade trial and further punishment in prison by other inmates for their crimes. It is the easy way out and of course, his lawyer will argue his suffering is ‚Äútoo arduous‚Äù but what about the endless suffering the victims will face? I think the mass shooter should be sent to trial and jail for his crimes and murders, if he could take so many lives so easily, he should truly pay the consequence by being forced to reflect for the rest of his life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|I believe that sadly the shooter still has his rights despite the moral and ethical look upon this, when in the court of law you have to respect and give both parties their rights fair and square. He has the right to as to die if he wishes to. But also I think they need to clarify which health issues would be accepted and which ones are not, and go from there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|I think that the shooter should serve his sentence for the crime he committed.

|In this case the victims families are right. This shooter was injured because he was injuring others. Not because this was something he couldn't control. Obviously if one plans to rampage and follow through with a mass shooting, they need to face and suffer the consequences. In no situation should he be able to escape his punishment, even if he wants to die. This was his choice, he was injured because of this choice, and now he must suffer the consequences. This is not only because it is the just procedure in this case, but the families of the victims deserve to have closure and peace of mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|Unlike the United States, where you are innocent until proven guilty, in Spain the standard is you are guilty until proven innocent. Because of this logic I believe that the family is right because once you have committed a crime, one loses certain freedoms and the right to choose when to die is or should be one of the rights that he lost when he committed the crime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|The mass shooter performed a horrible action, therefor he should be punished and serve life in prison, instead of just ending it all because he doesn't want to live with his mistakes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|If the law is followed by the book, then the shooter‚Äôs lawyers arguments are well founded. However, justice and the law are in my opinion two different things, justice would mean that the shooter gets punished for his crimes. In situations like this where justice contradicts the law, I think justice should be followed over the law as law is only rigid, whereas the justice always emphasizes good over bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|I don't think there is a "right" or "wrong" side to this, and I believe the families are completely valid in their feelings, but my personal opinion is that our justice system's current emphasis on punishment is very problematic, and so he should have the autonomy to carry on with euthanasia if both him and his doctors find it favorable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|I don't really believe in retribution as being the purpose of prisons and I don't see that the shooter serving life in prison will bring the victim's family closer to "justice". However, I do understand that they feel it is unfair that they lose someone close to them and that the perpetrator gets to leave the situation. So I'm not sure who is right here exactly but I would say that the shooter should able to commit euthanasia because of his injuries and the fact that he qualifies for that due to his quality of life being severly impacted because of health issues regardless of previously stated crime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|The families are right and he should indeed have the worst punishment which is life in prison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|The victims' families are correct, despite the complicated ethical implications. The defendant‚Äôs injury is a byproduct of his crime, so it is not a valid basis for euthanasia compared to a preexisting condition or accident. Additionally, the second two arguments are null because they prioritize personal preference over what is legally/constitutionally/judicially correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|he should go to trial and get sentenced to the death penalty. that way the families get justice and he gets to die.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

While euthanasia stands to be a law, it is also the law for the criminal to serve his time in order to bring justice to those who this mass shooter harmed. I believe the criminal should first face his punishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|I think I need more context on the circumstances of the shooting and how the shooter was injured and just the situation as a whole, but given the information provided I think if the shooter is in a state where he can not live anymore, the penalty of death is just as bad if not worse than a life in prison.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|I think the shooter is in the right.  I highly value bodily autonomy and having the choice what to do with your own body.  Even though he committed a heinous act, forcing someone to live with irreparable disabilities despite their crimes constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in my opinion as well.  All in all, voluntary death is a worthy punishment in and of it self, too.  Many shooters have killed themselves after their crimes after commiting them, and their is no outrage that they never stood trial.  The shooter should be able to voluntarily kill himself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|I think in this case he should go to trial and face prison time, but I also believe that the prison system should be more focused on rehabilation and holding people accountable. I also don't hold much pity for those who chose to commit atrocious acts against other people for no reason, so I believe the victims' families are correct in this case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

# True crime: we all want to kill 



|Why is true crime so popular?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

|I have a theory that most people want to be serial killers or want to murder  people but fall into the social pressures of society, feel easily judged or don't want to do jail time so they satisfy they're wants and needs of this by living through other people who actually have committed the similar crime they want to do also people are nosey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|While it is a daily occurrence, it also is probably a tragedy that feels detached from the individual watching. The event invokes an emotion that they would not generally feel, and they don't feel disgust because they can't imagine themselves facing a similar loss or problem in their lives. It gives them an emotion when watching that most other genres may not be able to give to the same extent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|I think that people love a good mystery and this genre of true crime does a fantastic job at making these mysteries more entertaining. Shows like NCSI or Criminal Minds showcases the process of piecing together a mystery in a way that engages the audience. People are curious and want to understand why such occurrences happen which draws them into this true crime genre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|I think people are fascinated by true crime because it reveals how twisted the human mind could become and also gives more insight into motive behind these crimes. While the details can be gory and sinister, the stories can often times teach listeners how to better protect themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|I think people want to know what goes on in the mind of people that would do things that most people would never think of attempting (for good reason).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|I think people are drawn to mystery and drama and I don't think there's anything more dramatic than a topic concerning life and death, so bringing mystery to that would likely lead to popularity. I think people are fascinated by these stories partly out of morbid curiosity but also partly out of confusion, because I and many others can't really comprehend carrying an act out such as murder, so watching something that tries to explain it can maybe answer that curiosity or confusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

I think true crime falls into both of those categories as they cannot fathom why people commit these unspeakable crimes and it scares them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|People are fascinated by the spectacle. Hearing stories of the worst possible situations makes peoples lives appear better in comparison.

|I think the main reason the true crime genre is so popular is because of morbid curiosity. Socially the act of murder and criminality is vilified. However this does not stop some from still engaging in these violent or criminal acts. Why is this? This question has long fascinated people. Some of the most cruel and evil people in all of human history are still talked about today. I believe this is because people are naturally fascinated by abnormality's in society. For example a hour long podcast about a mother who raises her normally through their childhood would not get much traction. On the other hand an hour long podcast about a mother who murders her children with no previous records of any similar behavior would get much more attention. I believe this is due to morbid curiosity which has excised in humans for as long as human history. True crime podcasts are simply the newest evolution of the curiosity.                       |
|I think people are so fascinated by these stories, because somehow the stories that are being told, tend to have a connection to the story somehow.

|I think people like true crime for the reason people like scary movies.

|I used to be a huge fan of the "true crime: genre, until I listened to a podcast about how a lot of true crime creators and shows oftentimes glorify the killers while getting little to no permission from the victims families to use these stories. However, I think that the reason that this type of content is so popular because it is a version of morbid escapism. I also read something about how women tend to enjoy true crime at a higher volume than men, I think that this could be because oftentimes women are the victims of said crime like murder or rape. In this way, I think some women consume true crime in order to "mentally prepare" for something like that to happen to them. We use it as a way to prepare how to not get kidnapped, like running with pepper spray or not wearing a ponytail out and about. I am not sure why men are so fascinated by these shows, but I think, to an extent it plays off their fascination of power dynamics. |

This also leads to a sense of it feeling like fiction, people are too disconnected from reality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|I am admittedly one of the people who consume true crime media (and I have been for a while now). The reason I listen to podcasts or watch documentaries is because I like knowing about the responses of the community after a crime has occurred, such as news coverage (sometimes, the lack thereof) or the investigative process.

I don't really like the gory details as much as what happens after, as it sends me into a spiral of imagining something happening to myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|I think this genre is popular because it covers details of the crime that most ordinary people would never think of committing (murder). This "uncharted territory" intrigues people, even if they would never consider killing someone else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|I was fascinated by the show Mindhunter which tells the story of the developing BAU. I think people are really into these stories because they can't imagine any of it happening so hearing it is kind of a culture shock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
